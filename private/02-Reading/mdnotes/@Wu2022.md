### 初读印象

comment:: 作者基于证据理论提出一种新的negation，不仅解决了先前negation运算在binary distribution case 失效的问题，同时比他们具有更快的收敛速度。

### Abstract
-   Negation operation is important in **intelligent information processing**.
-   This new negation can be seen as a kind of **geometry negation**.
-   The proposed exponential negation is an **entropy increase operation**.
-   The convergence speed is **faster** than the existed negation.
---
### Background
-   *Negation is an efficient way to analyze the knowledge, i.e. the higher-order information behind the probability distribution*.
-   Several negation methods have been developed based on research, like Tsallis entropy, D-S entropy, Z number etc.
-   All the existing negation methods have a similar structure of Yager's negation.
-   None of the existing methods can achieve the maximum entropy on the case of **binary distribution case**.
---
### Methodology
-   Unlike Yager's idea of using additive inverse for negation, the author used **the idea of the multiplicative inverse** to find the information of negation.
-   Considering the case when the probability is 0, the author use the **exponent structure** to avoid the meaningless situation.
-   Based on the **evidence theory**, the negation should contain some probability from the plausible probability.
-   Combine **the second law of thermodynamics** to better illustrate the new method.
---
### Contribution
-   The proposed method **work well in binary distribution** which cannot be achieved by the previous methods.
-   The new method **converge more quickly**, i.e. more efficient.
-   It coincides with the **second law of thermodynamics**.
-   While Yager's negation can be seen as **arithmetic negation**, the new method can be seen as **geometry negation** to some degree.

### Limitation

2.  Tables.
3.  Figures.
4.  Contradistinction

### Question to Think
1. In Deng entropy, the UM reaches its maximum when the distribution is proportional to scale of sub-focal sets[[@Kang2019]]. So does there exists another negation whose convergence remark is corresponded to the max deng entropy?

2. The convergent speed mostly results from the exponent structure, noticing that the factorial is faster than the exponent, So does it have any chance to find a factorial structure negation?

3. Since the negation can be seen as geometric negation, what if we apply a time negation as the probability negation or some kind like the bayes formula. Will the entropy increase to its maximum or decrease to minimum?
