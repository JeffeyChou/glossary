For instance, Nguyen proposed a belief entropy based on the original basic probability assignment (BPA) [34]. Dubois and Prade proposed a weighted Hartley entropy for measuring the non-specificity of BPAs [35]. In addition, many other belief entropies have been proposed, including Höhle’s entropy [36], Yager’s dissonance measure [37], Klir and Ramer’s discord measure [38], Klir and Parviz’s strife measure [39], Jousselme’s ambiguity measure (AM) [40], Deng entropy [41], Yang and Han’s measure [42], the aggregated uncertainty measure (AU) [43], Wang and Song’s measure (SU) [44], Jirousek and Shenoy’s entropy (JS) [45], Deng’s measure [46], and so on [47–49].”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10099416%2Fitems%2FLA2EQ9IP%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Zhang 等, 2021, p. 2</span>)</span> 基于上述分析，许多学者提出了不同的类熵测度来量化DST中证据体的不确定性。例如，Nguyen提出了一种基于原始基本概率分配( BPA )的信念熵[ 34 ]。Dubois和Prade提出了加权Hartley熵来衡量BPAs的非特异性[ 35 ]。此外，人们还提出了许多其他的信度熵，包括H ö hle熵[ 36 ]、Yager不一致测度[ 37 ]、Klir和Ramer不一致测度[ 38 ]、Klir和Parviz冲突测度[ 39 ]、Jousselme模糊测度( AM ) [ 40 ]、Deng熵[ 41 ]、Yang和Han测度[ 42 ]、聚合不确定测度( AU ) [ 43 ]、Wang和Song测度( SU ) [ 44 ]、伊劳谢克和Shenoy熵( JS ) [ 45 ]、Deng测度[ 46 ]等[ 47-49 ]。

The proposed method can measure both dissonance conflict and non-specificity in BPA, which includes two components. The first component is consistent with Yager’s dissonance measure. The second component is the non-specificity with different functions.
