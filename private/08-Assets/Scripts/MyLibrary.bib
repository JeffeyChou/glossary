  abstract = {The theory of Evidence, or Shafer-Dempster theory (DST), has been widely used in applications. The DST is based on the concept of a basic probability assignment. An important part of this theory is the quantification of the information-based-uncertainty that this function represents. A recent measure of uncertainty (or information) in this theory, called the Deng entropy, has appeared as an interesting alternative to the measures presented so far. This measure quantifies the both types of uncertainty found in DST, then it is considered as a total uncertainty measure (TU). It is shown that this measure does not verify some of the essential properties for a TU in DST such as monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity. Also, the definition of this new measure produces other debatable situations. These shortcomings call in question the utility of this measure in applications.},

First, the main models, frameworks, architectures, algorithms, solutions, problems, and requirements are analyzed. Second, a general data fusion engineering process is presented to show how complex it is to design a framework for a specific application. Third, an IQ approach , as well as the different methodologies and frameworks used to assess IQ in information systems are addressed; in addition, data fusion systems are presented along with their related criteria. Furthermore, information on the context in data fusion systems and its IQ assessment are discussed. Subsequently, the issue of data fusion systems‚Äô performance is reviewed. Finally, some key aspects and concluding remarks are outlined, and some future lines of work are gathered.},

  abstract = {The Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) includes an ontology that represents concepts and criteria needed to evaluate the uncertainty management aspects of a fusion system. The URREF ontology defines self-confidence as a measure of the information credibility as evaluated by the sensor itself. The concept of confidence, which is not explicitly defined in the ontology at URREF, has been extensively explored in the literature about evaluation in information fusion systems (IFS). In this paper, we provide a discussion on confidence as it relates to the evaluation of IFS, and compare it with the existing concepts in the URREF ontology. Our goal is two-fold, since we address both the distinctions between confidence and self-confidence, as well as the implications of these differences when evaluating the impact of uncertainty to the decision-making processes supported byt the IFS. We illustrate the discussion with an example of decision making that involves signal detection theory, confusion matrix fusion, subjective logic, and proportional conflict redistribution. We argue that uncertainty can be minimized through confidence (information evidence) and self-confidence (source agent) processing, The results here seek to enrich the ongoing discussion at the ISIF's Evaluation of Techniques for Uncertainty Representation Working Group (ETURWG) on self-confidence and trust in information fusion systems design.},

Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

We used 15-year prospective longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to evaluate two types of stability of core language skill in 5036 typically developing and 1056 atypically developing (preterm, dyslexic, autistic, and hearing impaired) children in a multiage, multidomain, multimeasure, multireporter framework. A single core language skill was extracted from multiple measures at multiple ages, and this skill proved stable from infancy to adolescence in all groups, even accounting for child nonverbal intelligence and sociability and maternal age and education. Language skill is a highly conserved and robust individual-differences characteristic. Lagging language skills, a risk factor in child development, would profitably be addressed early in life.},

These two mathematical frameworks share many fundamental ideas, but they also differ in some key properties. On the one hand, Markov theory obeys the law of total probability, but quantum theory does not; on the other hand, quantum theory obeys the doubly stochastic law, but Markov theory does not. Therefore, the decision about whether to use a Markov or a quantum system depends on which of these laws are empirically obeyed in an application. This article derives two general methods for testing these theories that are parameter free, and presents a new experimental test. The article concludes with a review of experimental findings from cognitive psychology that evaluate these two properties.},

Some numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of the proposed information volume of mass function.},

  abstract = {For exploring the meaning of the power set in evidence theory, a possible explanation of power set is proposed from the view of Pascal‚Äôs triangle and combinatorial number. Here comes the question: what would happen if the combinatorial number is replaced by permutation number? To address this issue, a new kind of set, named as random permutation set (RPS), is proposed in this paper, which consists of permutation event space (PES) and permutation mass function (PMF). The PES of a certain set considers all the permutation of that set. The elements of PES are called the permutation events. PMF describes the chance of a certain permutation event that would happen. Based on PES and PMF, RPS can be viewed as a permutation-based generalization of random finite set. Besides, the right intersection (RI) and left intersection (LI) of permutation events are presented. Based on RI and LI, the right orthogonal sum (ROS) and left orthogonal sum (LOS) of PMFs are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the proposed conceptions. The comparisons of probability theory, evidence theory, and RPS are discussed and summarized. Moreover, an RPS-based data fusion algorithm is proposed and applied in threat assessment. The experimental results show that the proposed RPS-based algorithm can reasonably and efficiently deal with uncertainty in threat assessment with respect to threat ranking and reliability ranking.},

  abstract = {Understanding the uncertainty involved in a mass function is a central issue in Dempster‚ÄìShafer evidence theory for uncertain information fusion. Recent advances suggest to interpret the mass function from a view of quantum theory. However, existing studies do not truly implement the quantization of evidence. In order to solve the problem, a usable quantization scheme for mass function is studied in this paper. At first, a novel quantum model of mass function is proposed, which effectively embodies the principle of quantum superposition. Then, a quantum averaging operator is designed to obtain the quantum average of evidence, which not only retains many basic properties, for example idempotency, commutativity, and quasi-associativity, required by a rational approach for uncertain information fusion, but also yields some new characters, namely nonlinearity and globality, caused by the quantization of mass functions. At last, based on the quantum averaging operator, a new rule called quantum average combination rule is developed for the fusion of multiple pieces of evidence, which is compared with other representative average-based combination methods to show its performance. Numerical examples and applications for classification tasks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantum model, averaging operator, and combination rule.},

  abstract = {Mathematical and uncertainty modelling is an important component of data fusion (the fusion of unprocessed sensor data) and information fusion (the fusion of processed or interpreted data). If uncertainties in the modelling process are not or are incorrectly accounted for, fusion processes may provide under- or overconfident results, or in some cases incorrect results. These are often owing to incorrect or invalid simplifying assumptions during the modelling process. The authors investigate the sources of uncertainty in the modelling process. In particular, four processes of abstraction are identified where uncertainty may enter the modelling process. These are isolation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced by isolating a portion of the real world to be modelled), datum uncertainty (where uncertainty is introduced by representing real world information by a mathematical quantity), data generation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of the mapping between a real-world process and an observable datum), and process abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of real world entities and processes). The uncertainties associated with these abstraction processes are characterised according to the uncertainty representation and reasoning evaluation framework (URREF) ontology. A Bayesian network information fusion use case that models the rhino poaching problem is utilised to demonstrate the taxonomies introduced in this paper.},

A typical flow of information in the decision loop takes the form of raw information, uncertainty modelling, combination, and decisions, which corresponds closely with Boyd's Observe, Orient, Decide and Act or OODA loop. The uncertainty associated with modelling during fusion system design was considered in previous works by the authors of this paper. Here, the uncertainties in the combination and decision parts of the information flow are considered. The objective of this paper is to make explicit how uncertainties that arise during design, combine with uncertainties during runtime, as well as the effect these uncertainties have on the ultimate decisions. The uncertainty representation and reasoning framework (URREF) ontology can only be meaningfully used for evaluation when the subjects of evaluation within the fusion system, and more broadly the decision loop, are defined explicitly.},

The thermal and fluid dynamic equations are given whereby the device may be mathematically modelled. Computer-generated results for thrust, pressure and temperature as a function of time are given and discussed. Comparing the theoretical with experimentally obtained thrust curves, it is concluded that the mathematical model reflects the physical behaviour of the device reasonably well. Limitations of the present model are discussed and it is recommended that the device should find application in heat transfer rather than as an engine.},

A theoretical model of such a device taking gravity, surface tension, friction and pressure into account is presented. The model uses vapour bubble, liquid plug and liquid film control volumes. An experimental model was constructed and tested using water as the working fluid. It was found that the device could operate indefinitely provided the heat source is less than 30 mm above the heat sink and that the temperature of the heat source is less than 160 ‚ó¶C. The theoretical model was able to predict these experimentally determined values. By calculating Lyapunov exponents it is shown that the theoretical model is able to reflect the characteristic chaotic behaviour of these devices. It was concluded that the model represents the experimental situation well and that it is important to consider the evaporation of liquid deposited on the surface by the trailing edge of the liquid plug. It is recommended that convective heat transfer is further investigated and the water pumping ability of the device is exploited.},

All participants watched two videos of an unfamiliar dog (tranquil and active). Subjective measures of stress, anxiety, alertness, attention, likeability, and cuteness were assessed. The results showed that the tranquil dog video significantly decreased anxiety only. Additionally, the active dog video significantly decreased stress and anxiety. Across the videos, the results showed the active dog video significantly improved subjective alertness and attention when compared with the tranquil dog video. Lastly, the active dog video was rated more likeable and cuter relative to the tranquil dog video. The practical implications of these findings could include how to improve various subjective mental states for humans in public settings (e.g., hospital) where nonhuman animals are not always allowed.}

But the relationship of the other entropy functions with Pascal triangle is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory takes the advantage to deal with uncertainty than probability theory since the probability distribution is generalized as basic probability assignment, which is more efficient to model and handle uncertain information. Given a basic probability assignment, its corresponding uncertainty measure can be determined by Deng entropy, which is the generalization of Shannon entropy. In this paper, a Pseudo-Pascal triangle based the maximum Deng entropy is constructed. Similar to the Pascal triangle modelling of Tasllis entropy, this work provides the a possible way of Deng entropy in physics and information theory.},

The fundamental understanding of the working of the part-unit cell is imperative in the development of a complete Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a PHP. The compressible model developed in the present work is based on the Volume-of-Fluid solver of the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM, in which the contour-based interface reconstruction algorithm and the contact-line evaporation model have been incorporated. Owing to the lack of a single standard benchmark validation case for a compressible phase-change solver, a huge emphasis in the present work is laid on the solver development and validation, the latter part of which is conducted in stages. Furthermore, simulations for the formation of a Taylor-Bubble through a constrained bubble growth are performed and the fallacy of an incompressible solver is shown distinctly. The validated solver is used to model a part-unit cell of a PHP and a parametric study is performed on the part-unit cell. The effect of variation of evaporator length, evaporator superheat, and liquid fill ratio on the performance of the PHP is discussed.},

  abstract = {Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) is a recently invented kind of thermal link of high thermal performance. The heat is transferred due to self-sustained oscillations of vapor bubbles and liquid plugs in a unique capillary tube which links the hot and cold sources in several turns or branches. Increasingly strong efforts are devoted to PHP simulation models which need to be experimentally assessed. Recent models show the importance of the thermodynamic state of the vapor bulk. Indeed it may deviate from the saturation conditions due to vapor transient compression/expansion. This study aims at measuring and calculating the vapor state in a horizontal single branch PHP which allows generating oscillations of a liquid meniscus in a capillary tube with one open end, at which the pressure is imposed. The experimental setup uses oxygen at cryogenic temperatures which reduces as much as possible the radiation losses of both sensors (microscopic thermocouple) used for the direct vapor temperature measurement and of the whole PHP. We present here the simultaneous experimental measurements of the vapor pressure and temperature. The data are compared to the theoretical modeling obtained within the film evaporation/condensation model of PHP [Das et al., 2010]. The model is extended to account for the thermal gradient along and across the tube walls formed because of the poor heat conductivity of its material. The vapor is found superheated, which demonstrates the relevance of the model. The vapor temperature oscillates around the evaporator temperature. The heat transfer between the vapor and the dry evaporator wall explains this result. The corresponding heat transfer coefficient is calculated using DNS. The comparison shows an agreement between the experiment and the model.},

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of such probability transformations (PTs), which are crucial for their proper applications and the design of new ones. Shannon entropy or probabilistic information content (PIC) measure is traditionally used in evaluating PTs. The transformation having the lowest entropy or highest PIC is considered as the best one. This standpoint is questioned in this paper by comparing a PT based on uncertainty minimization with other available PTs. It shows experimentally that entropy or PIC is not comprehensive to evaluate a PT. To make a comprehensive evaluation, some new approaches are proposed by the joint use of PIC and the distance of evidence according to the value- and rank-based fusion. A pattern classification application oriented evaluation approach for PTs is also proposed. Some desired properties for PTs are also discussed. Experimental results and related analysis are provided to show the rationality of the new evaluation approaches.},

  abstract = {For predicting the fully developed upward flow in a uniformly heated, vertical pipe by taking account of the buoyancy force, the k-Œµ models of turbulence for low Reynolds number flows were adopted. The regime map for forced, mixed and natural convections as well as for laminar and turbulent flows was plotted from the numerical predictions. At the same time, experiments were carried out at Reynolds numbers of 3000 and 5000, with the Grashof number varying over a wide range, by using pressurized nitrogen gas as a test fluid. In agreement with the prediction, buoyancy-induced impairment of heat transfer was correctly measured in the mixed convection regime. Furthermore, from hot-wire measurements, complete laminarization was demonstrated in the mixed-convection region at a Reynolds number of 3000. R√©sum√© On adopte le mod√®le k-Œµ pour pr√©dire l'√©coulement pleinement √©tabli, ascendant dans un tube vertical chauff√© uniform√©ment, en tenant compte des forces d'Archim√®de. On d√©termine num√©riquement la cartographie des r√©gimes pour les convections mixtes et naturelles, aussi bien que pour les √©coulements laminaires et turbulents. En m√™me temps, des exp√©riences sont conduites √† des nombres de Reynolds de 3000 et 5000, les nombres de Grashof variant largement, en utilisant de l'azote pressuris√© comme fluide d'essai. En accord avec le calcul, le transfert de chaleur est mesur√© dans le domaine de la convection mixte. De plus, √† partir des mesures au fil chaud, on trouve une compl√®te laminarisation dans la r√©gion de convection mixte √† un nombre de Reynolds de 3000. Zusammenfassung Zur Berechnung der voll ausgebildeten Aufw√§rtsstr√∂mung in einem gleichm√§Œ≤ig beheizten senkrechten Rohr unter Ber√ºcksichtigung der Auftriebskraft wurde das k-Œµ-Turbulenzmodell f√ºr Str√∂mungen bei kleinen Reynolds-Zahlen angewandt. Anhand der numerischen Berechnungen wurden sowohl f√ºr laminare als auch turbulente Str√∂mungen Bereichskarten f√ºr erzwungene, gemischte und nat√ºrliche Konvektion erstellt. Zur gleichen Zeit wurden Versuche mit verdichtetem Stickstoff als Versuchsfluid bei Reynolds-Zahlen zwischen 3000 und 5000 in einem weiten Bereich von Grashof-Zahlen durchgef√ºhrt. In √úbereinstimmung mit den Berechnungen wurde im Bereich der Mischkonvektion eine Beeintr√§chtigung des W√§rme√ºbergangs durch die Auftriebsbewegung gemessen. Dar√ºber hinaus wurde aufgrund von Hitzdrahtmessungen der vollst√§ndige Umschlag zur Laminarstr√∂mung im Bereich der Mischkonvektion bei einer Reynolds-Zahl von 3000 gezeigt. –†–µ—Ñ–µ—Ä–∞—Ç –î–ª—è Pay—áeTa –øo–ª–ΩoyT—å—é Pa–∑–≤–∏To–≥o –≤oy—áo–¥—è—âe–≥o –øoTo–∫a B Pa–≤–Ωo–ºeP–Ωo –Ωa–≥Pe–≤ae–ºo–π –≤ePT–∏–∫a–ª—å–Ωo–π TPc–±e y c—áeTo–º –øo–¥—äe–º–Ω—ã—á y–∏–ª –øPe–¥–ªo–∂e–Ω—ã k-Œµ –ºo–¥e–ª–∏ TcP–±c–ªe–ΩT–ΩoyT–∏ –¥–ª—è Te—áe–Ω–∏—è y –ºa–ª—ã–º —á–∏y–ªo–º Pe–π–Ωo–ª—å–¥ya. –üo –¥a–Ω–Ω—ã–º —á–∏y–ªe–Ω–Ω—ã—á Pay—áeTo–≤ –øoyTPoe–Ω—ã –≥Pa—Ñ–Ω–∫–∏ Te—áe–Ω–∏–π –¥–ª—è –≤—ã–Ωc–∂–¥e–Ω–Ωo–π, y–ºe—àa–Ω–Ωo–π –∏ eyTeyT–≤e–Ω–Ωo–π –∫o–Ω–≤e–∫—Ü–∏–π B –ªa–º–∏–ΩaP–Ωo–º –∏ TcP–±c–ªe–ΩT–Ωo–º PeQz–∏–ºa—á.

  abstract = {Boiling flow inside a wall heated vertical pipe is simulated by a multi-field CFD approach. Sub-cooled water enters the pipe from the lower end and heats up first in the near wall region leading to the generation of small bubbles. Further along the pipe larger and larger bubbles are generated by coalescence and evaporation. This leads to transitions of the two-phase flow patterns from bubbly to churn-turbulent and annular flow. The CFD simulation bases on the recently developed GEneralized TwO Phase flow (GENTOP) concept. It is a multi-field model using the Euler-Euler approach. It allows the consideration of different local flow morphologies including transitions between them. Small steam bubbles are handled as dispersed phases while the interface of large gas structures is statistically resolved. The paper presents the extension of the GENTOP model for phase transfer and discusses the sub-models used. Finally the above mentioned boiling pipe is considered as demonstration case.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete model for granular materials with rolling resistance. The salient features of our formulation are: it consists of a geometrically derived kinematical model, physically based mechanical contact models and locally equilibrated equations governing the motion of the rigid particles; only one additional parameter d needs to be introduced in the model when compared with the standard discrete element method (DEM). In the study, precise definitions of pure sliding and pure rolling were proposed, and a decomposition of a general contact displacement was given in terms of these rolling and sliding components which are then linked to energy dissipation. The standard DEM assumption that grains are in contact at discrete points was here replaced by the assumption that grains are in contact over a width. By making the idealization that the grain contact width is continuously distributed with normal/tangential basic elements, we established a rolling contact model together with normal/tangential contact models, and also related the governing equations to local equilibrium. As an example of its application, the present model was incorporated into a DEM code to study the angle of internal friction / of the material. Fifty-four DEM simulations showed that / predicted by the novel model was increased in comparison to the standard DEM prediction, and may be closer to the values observed experimentally provided that the d‚Äì/ relationship established in this paper was used.},

The CFD simulation has successfully predicted, for the first time, a boiling regime and two phase flow pattern that takes place with water at low power throughput, known as geyser boiling. The effects of the power throughput on the characteristics of the geyser boiling were investigated. The CFD simulation was also successful in modelling and visualising the multiphase flow characteristics, emphasising the difference in pool boiling behaviour between these working fluids. Temperature profiles and visual validation of the resulting 3D CDF findings were conducted using two experimental facilities.},

Local hydrodynamic characteristics such as velocities, lengths, shapes and profiles of bubbles and slugs, their dynamic contact angles, thickness of the liquid film that surrounds the bubbles, enhanced mixing/ flow circulation within the liquid slugs and net pressure drop along the flow, etc., are needed to predict local heat transfer and thus, the global thermal performance. In this paper, we systematically review the experimental, theoretical/analytical, and modeling methodologies to predict these hydrodynamic properties in unidirectional two-phase Taylor bubble flows, in the context of Pulsating Heat Pipes. Indeed, there is little literature available for oscillating Taylor bubbles flows. In view of the state-of-the-art, we therefore recommend some directions and perspectives for furthering research on understanding and modeling PHPs.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of evidence theory, data fusion consists in obtaining a single belief function by the combination of several belief functions resulting from distinct information sources. The most popular rule of combination, called Dempster‚Äôs rule of combination (or the orthogonal sum), has several interesting mathematical properties such as commutativity or associativity. However, combining belief functions with this operator implies normalizing the results by scaling them proportionally to the conflicting mass in order to keep some basic properties. Although this normalization seems logical, several authors have criticized it and some have proposed other solutions. In particular, Dempster‚Äôs combination operator is a poor solution for the management of the conflict between the various information sources at the normalization step. Conflict management is a major problem especially during the fusion of many information sources. Indeed, the conflict increases with the number of information sources. That is why a strategy for re-assigning the conflicting mass is essential. In this paper, we define a formalism to describe a family of combination operators. So, we propose to develop a generic framework in order to unify several classical rules of combination. We also propose other combination rules allowing an arbitrary or adapted assignment of the conflicting mass to subsets. √ì 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Various experiments were conducted on two full-size pulsating heat pipes (PHP) which differed from their diameter, number of turns, and working fluid. The analysis of the experimental results showed two kind of operating curves (overall thermal resistance vs. heat rate): for low heat fluxes, the curve is irregular and the PHP performance is sensitive to the orientation. For high heat fluxes, the operating curve is smooth and independent from the orientation. To contribute to the analysis of these results, experiments were conducted at the scale of a single branch of a PHP. An oscillating motion was imposed to a single liquid plug surrounded by two vapour slugs in a capillary tube and high speed visualizations were performed. The test section was either adiabatic or heated. The adiabatic experiments brought to the fore the importance of dynamic contact angles in the flow and the dissymmetry between the advancing and receding contact angle. The non-adiabatic experiments showed that at low flux, the flow is disturbed by bubble nucleation, while at high heat flux, the main heat transfer mechanism is thin film evaporation, with a completely different thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour.},

These studies have mainly focused on investigating which alternative would be appropriate for which conflicting situation, under the assumption that a conflict is identified. The issue of detection (or identification) of conflict among evidence has been ignored. In this paper, we formally define when two basic belief assignments are in conflict. This definition deploys quantitative measures of both the mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset before normalization and the distance between betting commitments of beliefs. We argue that only when both measures are high, it is safe to say the evidence is in conflict. This definition can be served as a prerequisite for selecting appropriate combination rules.},

  abstract = {Classifier fusion is an efficient strategy to improve the classification performance for the complex pattern recognition problem. In practice, the multiple classifiers to combine can have different reliabilities and the proper reliability evaluation plays an important role in the fusion process for getting the best classification performance. We propose a new method for classifier fusion with contextual reliability evaluation (CFCRE) based on inner reliability and relative reliability concepts. The inner reliability, represented by a matrix, characterizes the probability of the object belonging to one class when it is classified to another class. The elements of this matrix are estimated from the K-nearest neighbors of the object. A cautious discounting rule is developed under belief functions framework to revise the classification result according to the inner reliability. The relative reliability is evaluated based on a new incompatibility measure which allows to reduce the level of conflict between the classifiers by applying the classical evidence discounting rule to each classifier before their combination. The inner reliability and relative reliability capture different aspects of the classification reliability. The discounted classification results are combined with Dempster‚ÄìShafer‚Äôs rule for the final class decision making support. The performance of CF-CRE have been evaluated and compared with those of main classical fusion methods using real data sets. The experimental results show that CF-CRE can produce substantially higher accuracy than other fusion methods in general. Moreover, CF-CRE is robust to the changes of the number of nearest neighbors chosen for estimating the reliability matrix, which is appealing for the applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress‚Äìstrain and strain localization behavior of granular materials using the discrete element method. The study used the Particle Flow Code (PFC) to simulate biaxial compression tests in granular materials. To study the effects of rolling resistance, a user-defined rolling resistance model was implemented in PFC. A series of parametric studies was performed to investigate the effects of different levels of rolling resistance on the stress‚Äìstrain response and the emergence and development of shear bands in granular materials. The PFC models were also tested under a range of macro-mechanical parameters and boundary conditions. It is shown that rolling resistance affects the elastic, shear strength and dilation response of granular materials, and new relationships between rolling resistance and macroscopic elasticity, shear strength and dilation parameters are presented. It is also concluded that the rolling resistance has significant effects on the orientation, thickness and the timing of the occurrence of shear bands. The results reinforce prior conclusions by Oda et al. (Mech Mater 1:269‚Äì283, 1982) on the importance of rolling resistance in promoting shear band formation in granular materials. It is shown that increased rolling resistance results in the development of columns of particles in granular materials during strain hardening process. The buckling of these columns of particles in narrow zones then leads to the development of shear bands. High gradients of particle rotation and large voids are produced within the shear band as a result of the buckling of the columns.},

It is based on the concept of basic probability assignment (BPA). In DST, it is important to quantify the uncertainty (or information) that a BPA represents. An uncertainty measure, known as Deng entropy, was introduced as an interesting alternative to other measures proposed before. In previous work, it was shown that the Deng entropy does not verify most of the required properties for this type of measure and presents some undesirable behaviors. Two modifications of the Deng entropy have been recently proposed, which improve the original one. In this research, we demonstrate that these modifications do also not satisfy the majority of the necessary mathematical properties, and they present most of the behavioral drawbacks of the original one. Therefore, as the original Deng entropy, the modified ones should be cautiously employed in practical applications.},

The convections develop in either whole- or multi-layered modes, once the gas injection flux exceeds a critical value (Nakamura               et al.               ,               Phys. Rev.               E, vol. 102, 2020, 053102). We determine the nonlinear evolution of these modes of flows with varying injection flux and find that the whole- and multi-layered modes develop through subcritical and supercritical bifurcations, respectively. The formation of gas plumes is observed in both cases when the nonlinearity is significant. Examining energy transfer from base to perturbation flows, we show that the lift forces on bubbles play a key role in the bifurcations. While they impede the convections in both subcritical and supercritical bifurcations at weak nonlinearity, the lift forces turn to driving the convections in the subcritical bifurcation as nonlinearity increases.},

While much of the current research is involved with evaluating fusion systems based on the quality of their outputs, this paper describes the expansion of this scope to include the complexity of the inputs. Since the quality of the outputs is highly dependent on the difficulty of the input scenario, the methodology described in this paper provides us with a more well-rounded interpretation of fusion system performance. Moreover, characterization and quantification of input scenarios allows for the creation and variation of test scenarios, leading to more efficient optimization of fusion systems. A series of complexity and performance metrics were designed according to a common standard to measure the various aspects of the input scenario and the fusion system solution. Finally, these metrics are combined to obtain an assessment index which provides a description of the fusion system performance.},

  abstract = {The Pulsating (called also oscillating) Heat Pipe (PHP) is a high performance passive heat transfer device. It consists in a closed capillary channel folded into several meanders, evacuated, and partially filled with a liquid and its vapor. One side is in thermal contact with a hot spot, the other with a cold spot. The oscillation of the liquid plugs and vapor bubbles spontaneously occurs after the heating beginning. The heat exchange takes place not only by latent heat transfer, but also by liquid convection. Both this advantage and the PHP structural simplicity make it competitive with respect to other kinds of heat pipes. However, the PHP operation is non-stationary and depends on many physical and material parameters. As a result, application of empirical correlations is quite unsuccessful. More sophisticated direct modeling is thus required. In this review, we present the past, present, and future perspectives of the theoretical PHP studies. The physical phenomena on the level of a single bubble and single liquid plug is addressed first. In this context, the modeling of the simplest, single branch PHP is described as a necessary first step toward the PHP understanding and model validation. The modeling of interaction between the bubbles and plugs (bubble generation and disappearance, plug evaporation) is discussed next. Finally, the state of the art of the physical modeling and simulation of the multi-turn PHP is reviewed and the difference between existing approaches is explained.},

  abstract = {Kawaii (a Japanese word meaning ‚Äò‚Äòcute‚Äô‚Äô) things are popular because they produce positive feelings. However, their effect on behavior remains unclear. In this study, three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of viewing cute images on subsequent task performance. In the first experiment, university students performed a fine motor dexterity task before and after viewing images of baby or adult animals. Performance indexed by the number of successful trials increased after viewing cute images (puppies and kittens; M 6 SE = 43.9610.3\% improvement) more than after viewing images that were less cute (dogs and cats; 11.965.5\% improvement). In the second experiment, this finding was replicated by using a non-motor visual search task. Performance improved more after viewing cute images (15.762.2\% improvement) than after viewing less cute images (1.462.1\% improvement). Viewing images of pleasant foods was ineffective in improving performance (1.262.1\%). In the third experiment, participants performed a global‚Äìlocal letter task after viewing images of baby animals, adult animals, and neutral objects. In general, global features were processed faster than local features. However, this global precedence effect was reduced after viewing cute images. Results show that participants performed tasks requiring focused attention more carefully after viewing cute images. This is interpreted as the result of a narrowed attentional focus induced by the cuteness-triggered positive emotion that is associated with approach motivation and the tendency toward systematic processing. For future applications, cute objects may be used as an emotion elicitor to induce careful behavioral tendencies in specific situations, such as driving and office work.},

Kawaii is a Japanese word that roughly translates to cute in English, but its meaning appears to be broader than cute. Specifically, cuteness is often regarded as synonymous with infant physical attractiveness, whereas kawaii is used not only for babies but also for noninfantile objects. In this study, psychophysiological responses were compared between two types of kawaii pictures: human babies and animals (kawaii with baby schema) or objects such as desserts and dress accessories (kawaii without baby schema). Twenty female university students were asked to view various pictures twice. Both types of kawaii pictures were rated to be more pleasant than neutral pictures, elicited a greater activation of the zygomaticus major muscles associated with smiling, and were viewed for a longer period when the same pictures were presented again. The effect of baby schema appeared in the zygomaticus major muscle activity, which was greater for pictures with baby schema. The findings suggest that the word kawaii expresses positive feelings that are more generic than infant attractiveness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a preferable object.},

Based on the finding that feelings of cuteness toward the baby schema improves task performance (Sherman et al., 2009), this study will investigate the effect on task performance of feelings of cuteness toward things which don‚Äôt have the baby schema. Eighty-two university students were presented with cute images without a baby schema and noncute images. Before and afterwards, they were asked to carry out fine motor dexterity task and visual search task. Performing a two-way ANOVA, taking the number of successful trials as task performance, showed that performance was significantly improved after the presentation of cute images. This suggests that feelings of cuteness toward things without a baby schema may elicit approach motivation, leading to improved performance. Because feelings of cuteness with a baby schema increase discretion, we may consider the possibility that these results show a unique effect toward cute things without a baby schema.},

We conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter as well as a web survey experiment with both robot and human presenters. Based on the phenomenon that people more firmly touch an object when their perceived               kawaii               feeling is overwhelmingly strong, we investigated the effects of touching behavior with emphasized styles. First, we conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter where participants observed their presentations about an object to explain its characteristics. The results showed that participants who observed the robot‚Äôs touch behaviors perceived the object to be more               kawaii               and thought that the robot also felt the object was more               kawaii               . On the other hand, the results did not effectively show any increase in the participant‚Äôs feelings of               kawaii               toward the robot or the emphasized touch style. Based on these results, we next conducted a web survey experiment to investigate whether such knowledge about touching effects is applicable for human presenters. The results resembled those obtained when the presenter was a robot, i.e., viewing a touch behavior increased both the presenter‚Äôs perceived feelings of               kawaii               toward the object and the participant‚Äôs feelings of               kawaii               toward it.

  abstract = {Distance measures provide a novel perspective for measuring the difference or consistency between bodies of evidence, which have been used in a wide range of fields. However, under the framework of quantum mass function, existing distances cannot measure the difference. Hence, this paper formulates a new distance measure, referred to as the distance of the quantum mass functions. The purpose of this distance measure is to quantify the difference between quantum mass functions. It can be demonstrated mathematically that it is a strict distance measure that satisfies the nonnegativity, symmetry, definiteness, triangle inequality. The proposed distance measure is a generalization of the classical evidence distance, and it introduces the concept of Minkowski distance as well. It is therefore not only able to reflects the difference of discord and non-specificity in the mass functions, but it also has the advantage of Minkowski distance, as well as high compatibility. Moreover, A number of numerical examples are also provided to illustrate its properties and advantages. Using the proposed distance measure, we design a new information fusion method based on the discount coefficient within a complex framework. As a further investigation, the proposed fusion method is applied to several data sets experiments and results indicate that compared to other methods, it has a certain potential in the field of multi-source information fusion under the framework of evidence theory.},

The boiling process has been maintained on the nucleate regimen varying heat flux from 0.1 MW/m2 to 1 MW/m2, though image processing was only feasible below 0.65 MW/m2. The result of the experimental work is a database of the size distribution of the bubbles at each experimental point and presented as an electronic annex. The results confirmed that bubbles are generally smaller at higher pressure, higher velocities and higher levels of subcooling. The effect of surface morphology proved to be a very strong factor that is normally ignored by correlations and experimental works.

  abstract = {Experimental studies were performed to investigate the thermal performance of three closed-loop oscillating heat pipes (CLOHPs) operating at the vertical bottom heat mode with heating power input in a range of 15‚Äì127 W. The tested CLOHPs are all made from copper capillary tubes with inner diameters (IDs) of 1.2, 2, and 2.4 mm. Two working fluids, pure water and ethanol, were used with filling ratios of 40\%, 50\%, and 60\% by volume. The evaporator of each CLOHP was electrically heated with alterable lengths, while the condenser was liquid cooled with a constant length. Experimental results show that the thermal performance of the CLOHPs depends on the conjugation effects of working fluid, filling ratio, inner diameter, evaporator length, and heating power input. The 2 mm ID and 2.4 mm ID CLOHPs had better thermal performance when charged with water as compared with ethanol, while ethanol was preferred for the 1.2 mm ID CLOHP. The thermal performance of these CLOHPs was enhanced at the relatively lower filling ratios (40\% and 50\%). An optimum evaporator length corresponding to the lowest thermal resistance was proved. Finally, an empirical correlation based on 510 sets of available experimental data both from the present study and other literatures was proposed to predict the thermal performance of vertical CLOHPs. The proposed correlation agreed with the experimental data within a deviation of approximately ¬±40\%.},

This system represents the simplest ‚Äòunit-cell‚Äô version of a pulsating heat pipe (PHP). An experimental setup has been built to visualise and record the meniscus oscillations and the thin liquid film that is laid on the wall when the meniscus leaves the evaporator. The pressure and temperature of the vapour are also simultaneously measured. When the temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink increases, different meniscus dynamics, having excellent repeatability, is observed. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that evaporation of the liquid film is responsible for these patterns. The different components of evaporation and condensation processes are critically analysed. Two different modes of evaporation are observed inside the system: one at the triple-line and one at the liquid‚Äìvapour interface. Considering that no comprehensive model of PHP system is available, the conclusions and directions provided in this study are important for building a broader understanding.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a System-of-Systems (SoS) perspective for integrated design and evaluation of an Information Fusion System (IFS). IFS is comprised of distributed and heterogeneous systems that accomplish low-level and high-level information fusion (LLIF and HLIF) functionality. LLIF and HLIF functions are developed independent from one another but require collaboration to achieve the IFS mission objectives. The distribution and heterogeneity of systems, in addition to the multiplicity of LLIF and HLIF functions, creates an extensively large design space for the IFS. We apply a SoS engineering architecting process to obtain integrated architectures of IFS and propose guidelines to constrain an otherwise infinite design space of Information Fusion System-of-Systems (IF-SoS). Furthermore, we elaborate a multi-agent system modeling approach and pair it with Design of Experiments for objective evaluation of the IF-SoS design space. The statistical analysis, based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Range Tests, quantifies the impact of interactions between LLIF and HLIF design considerations on the IF-SoS performance. Furthermore, statistical evidence is provided to demonstrate that the interactions among JDL levels, in particular between LLIF and HLIF, are the most significant design considerations for fusion performance which necessitate an integrated design and evaluation of LLIF and HLIF‚Äîa manifestation of the SoS perspective for the IFS.},

  abstract = {Models that introduce rolling resistance at the contact are widely employed in simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) to indirectly represent particle shape effects. This approach offers substantial compu¬≠ tational benefits at the price of increased calibration complexity. This work proposes a method to simplify calibration of rolling resistance. The key element is an empirical relation between a contact parameter (rolling friction) and a 3D grain shape descriptor (true sphericity). Values of true sphericity can be obtained by image analysis of the grains, either directly by 3D acquisition or by correlation with simpler-to-obtain 2D shape measures. Evaluation of rolling friction is thus made independent from that of other model parameters. As an extra benefit, the variability of grain shape in natural sands can be directly mapped into the discrete model. A mapping between rolling friction and true sphericity is calibrated using specimen-scale and grain scale results from two triaxial compression tests on Hostun sand and Caicos ooids. The mapping is validated using different triaxial tests from the same sands and from other reference sands (Ottawa, Ticino). In the case of Ticino grainshape acquisition is made in 2D, using an ordinary table scanner. The results obtained support this direct cali¬≠ bration procedure.},

Aspect ratio was 5 while the inclination angels were 0ÔøΩ, 80ÔøΩ and 90ÔøΩ, and the evaporator temperature were 50, 70 and 90 ÔøΩC. Furthermore, the addition rate of chemical reactants was 50\% by volume of the evaporator component whilst the water temper¬≠ ature within the condensation unit was maintained at 20 ÔøΩC. From the experimental results, the TPCT‚Äôs inner diameter was 7 mm, the inclination angels were at 80ÔøΩ and 90ÔøΩ. There were four types of flow pattern including; bubble flow pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and annular flow pattern. Churn flow pattern and the annular flow pattern affected the heat transfer rate of the TPCT with the inner diameter of 7 mm at the inclination angels of 80 and 90ÔøΩ respectively. As for the TPCT test, the inner diameter of 25.2 mm with the inclination angels of 80ÔøΩ resulted in four types of the flow patterns, including the bubble flow pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and stratified flow pattern respectively. According to the results, churn and stratified flow patterns, were the types of flow that affected the heat transfer rate. According to the experiment of TPCT with inner diameter of 25.2 mm at the inclination angels of 90ÔøΩ, four flow patterns including the bubble pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and the vortex flow pattern were found. The vertex flow pattern was initiated when the temperature of the evaporator section was raised from 70 to 90 ÔøΩC. According to this experiment, the churn flow and the vortex flow patterns were able to affect the heat transfer rates. Furthermore, the experiment revealed that heat flux that was obtained from the experiments of TPCT with the inner diameter of 7 and 25.2 mm showed the highest heat transfer rate at evaporation temperature of 90 ÔøΩC and the inclination angels of 80ÔøΩ which were 31.88 and 58.15 W, respectively.},

To address this issue, a possible explanation of power set is proposed in this paper. A power set of n events can be seen as all possible k-combination, where k ranges from 0 to n. It means the power set extends the event space in probability theory into all possible combination of the single basic event. From the view of power set, all subsets or all combination of basic events, are created equal. These subsets are assigned with the mass function, whose uncertainty can be measured by Deng entropy. The relationship between combinatorial number, Pascal‚Äôs triangle and power set is revealed by Deng entropy quantitively from the view of information measure.},

As a result of these changes it appeared the need of evaluating the information fusion system quality and to propose to the user the information accompanied with confidence coefficients. The information fusion systems used nowadays are complex systems that are difficult to be evaluated. To overcome this problem we propose a new quality evaluation methodology based on the decomposition of the information fusion system in its elementary modules that allows the evaluation of the quality at two levels. The first one (global) that describes the entire information fusion system and the second one (local) for each elementary module. As data and information change over time, this decomposition allows to directly evaluate the global quality of the information fusion system using the local quality evaluation.},

We propose a definition of the rolling resistance force and torque, and carry out experiments with a basketball and medicine ball rolling on a bed of gravel to measure the corresponding rolling resistance coefficients. These experiments reveal, in good agreement with literature, coefficients that are velocityindependent, and show that little to no plowing of the spheres into the granular substrate occurs. This indicates a regime of motion distinctly different from those treated in previous works. A simplified model correctly predicts the velocity independence and suggests an inverse dependence of the rolling resistance coefficient on the reduced inertia of the ball. These predictions match the experimentally observed behavior. Numerical simulations based on soft-sphere DEM shed more light on the mechanics of energy dissipation that occur in this no-plowing regime, and reveal a mass dependency that is not captured by the model. Our results provide insight into an unstudied regime of motion, and are of interest to the mission design of spacecraft to explore the surfaces of asteroids and comets.},

In the new proposed method, the scale of the frame of discernment (FOD) and the relative scale of a focal element with reference to FOD are considered.

  abstract = {Early-stage romantic love has been studied previously in the United States and United Kingdom (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327‚Äì337; Bartels and Zeki [2000]: Neuroreport 11:3829‚Äì3834; Ortigue et al. [2007]: J Cogn Neurosci 19:1218‚Äì1230), revealing activation in the reward and motivation systems of the brain. In this study, we asked what systems are activated for early-stage romantic love in Easterners, specifically Chinese participants? Are these activations affected by individual differences within a cultural context of Traditionality and Modernity? Also, are these brain activations correlated with later satisfaction in the relationship? In Beijing, we used the same procedure used by Aron et al. (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327‚Äì337). The stimuli for 18 Chinese participants were a picture of the face of their beloved, the face of a familiar acquaintance, and a countback task. We found significant activations specific to the beloved in the reward and motivation systems, particularly, the ventral tegmental area and the caudate. The mid-orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum were also activated, whereas amygdala, medial orbitofrontal, and medial accumbens activity were decreased relative to the familiar acquaintance. Self-reported Traditionality and Modernity scores were each positively correlated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, although in different regions and sides of the brain. Activity in the subgenual area and the superior frontal gyrus was associated with higher relationship happiness at 18-month follow-up. Our results show that midbrain dopamine-rich reward/motivation systems were activated by early-stage romantic love in Chinese participants, as found by other studies. Neural activity was associated with Traditionality and Modernity attitudes as well as with later relationship happiness for Chinese participants. Hum Brain Mapp 32:249‚Äì257, 2011.

  abstract = {The theory of belief functions is a very important and effective tool for uncertainty modeling and reasoning, where measures of uncertainty are very crucial for evaluating the degree of uncertainty in a body of evidence. Several uncertainty measures in the theory of belief functions have been proposed. However, existing measures are generalizations of measures in the probabilistic framework. The inconsistency between different frameworks causes limitations to existing measures. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, a new total uncertainty measure is proposed directly in the framework of belief functions theory without changing the theoretical frameworks. The average distance between the belief interval of each singleton and the most uncertain case is used to represent the total uncertainty degree of the given body of evidence. Numerical examples, simulations, applications and related analyses are provided to verify the rationality of our new measure.},

The heat transfer solutions are applied to the thermal model of the pulsating heat pipe and a parametric study was performed. The results show that the heat transfer in a PHP is mainly due to the exchange of sensible heat. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillation is almost una¬Äected by surface tension after steady oscillation has been established. The amplitude of oscillation decreases with decreasing diameter. The amplitude of oscillation also decreases when the wall temperature of the heating section is decreased, but the frequency of oscillation is almost unchanged. √ì 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Multi-Source Information Fusion (MSIF) is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary subject, and is referred to as, multi-sensor information fusion which was originated in the 1970s. Nowadays, the types and updates of data are becoming more multifarious and frequent, which bring new challenges for information fusion to deal with the multi-source data. Consequently, the construction of MSIF models suitable for different scenarios and the application of different fusion technologies are the core problems that need to be solved urgently. Rough set theory (RST) provides a computing paradigm for uncertain data modeling and reasoning, especially for classification issues with noisy, inaccurate or incomplete data. Furthermore, due to the rapid development of MSIF in recent years, the methodologies of learning under RST are becoming increasingly mature and systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in the literature. In order to better clarify the approaches and application of MSIF in RST research community, this paper reviews the existing models and technologies from the perspectives of MSIF model (i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous MSIF model), multi-view rough sets information fusion model (i.e., multi-granulation, multi-scale and multi-view decisions information fusion models), parallel computing information fusion model, incremental learning fusion technology and cluster ensembles fusion technology. Finally, RST based MSIF related research directions and challenges are also covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art understanding in specialized literature, this survey will directly help researchers understand the research developments of MSIF under RST.},

But in real life, the results of things usually change over time, and the prediction of the information volume contained in the future is still an open question. Deng entropy proposed by Deng in recent years is widely applied on measuring the uncertainty, but its physical explanation is controversial. In this paper, we give Deng entropy a new explanation based on the fractal idea, and proposed its generalization called time fractal-based (TFB) entropy. The TFB entropy is recognized as predicting the uncertainty over a period of time by splitting times, and its maximum value, called higher order information volume of mass function (HOIVMF), can express more uncertain information than all of existing methods.},

  abstract = {The total uncertainty measurement of basic probability assignment (BPA) in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) has always been an open issue. Although some scholars put forward various measurements and entropies of BPA, due to the existence of discord and non-specificity, there is no method can measure BPA reasonably. In order to utilize BPA to practical decision-making, pignistic probability transformation of BPA is a significant method. In the paper, we simulate the pignistic probability transformation (PPT) process based on the fractal idea, which describes PPT process in detail and shows the process of information volume changes during transformation intuitively. Based on transformation process, we propose a new belief entropy called fractal-based belief (FB) entropy. After verification, FB entropy is superior to all existing belief entropies in terms of total uncertainty measurement and physical model consistency.},
