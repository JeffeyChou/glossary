However, the rapid growth of scientific publications and digital data makes identifying the right experts a challenging problem. Existing approaches for finding experts given a topic can be categorised into information retrieval techniques such as vector space models, document language models, and graph-based models. In this paper, we propose ExpFinder , a new hybrid model for expert finding, that integrates a novel N-gram vector space model, denoted as nVSM, and a graph-based model, denoted as μCO-HITS, that is a proposed variation of the CO-HITS algorithm. The key of nVSM is to exploit recent inverse document frequency weighting method for N-gram words, and ExpFinder incorporates nVSM into μCO-HITS to achieve expert finding. We comprehensively evaluate ExpFinder on four different datasets from the academic domains in comparison with six different expert finding models. The evaluation results show that ExpFinder is an highly effective model for expert finding, substantially outperforming all the compared models in 19% to 160.2%.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422017237","extra":"Citation Key: kang2023expfinder","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"211","pages":"118691","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118691","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yong-Bin","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Du","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdur Rahim Mohammad","lastName":"Forkan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prem Prakash","lastName":"Jayaraman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Aryani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timos","lastName":"Sellis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bipartite graph"},{"tag":"Co-hits"},{"tag":"Expert collaboration graph"},{"tag":"Expert finding"},{"tag":"ExpFinder"},{"tag":"Text-based expertise"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4CZF6L3R","itemID":1465,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933422,"version":0},"$loki":542},{"itemID":1508,"item":{"key":"4FH2AV7U","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved sparse representation based robust hybrid feature extraction models with transfer and deep learning for EEG classification","abstractNote":"Numerous studies in the field of cognitive research is dependent on Electroencephalography (EEG) as it apprehends the neural correspondences of various mental activities such as memory, speech, or attention related activities with millisecond precision. In this work, initially sparse rendition is imposed on EEG signals and then sparse optimization is performed to it. For sparse representation, initially the work utilized both K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) for dictionary learning along with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for sparse coding. Later an advanced OMP technique was developed which made a significant improvement, and then instead of K-SVD, K-means and Method of Optimal direction (MOD) techniques were utilized with it and as a result, totally six different combinations in sparse representation optimization were developed. Then, it is modelled into clusters using seven different hybrid models developed here for the purpose of feature extraction and selection. Out of the seven models, two models are already existing such as Finite Mixture Logistic Regression Model (FMLR) and Expectation-Maximization based Gaussian Mixture Model (EM-GMM) which are widely used. The remaining five hybrid models are proposed as variations of GMM such as Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization (VBMF) based GMM (VBMF-GMM), VBMF and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with GMM (VBMF-PCA-GMM), VBMF and Partial Least Squares (PLS) with GMM (VBMF-PLS-GMM), VBMF and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) with GMM (VBMF-CCA-GMM) and Empirical VBMF with GMM (EVBMF-GMM). This model is validated on two unique EEG datasets, such as epilepsy dataset and schizophrenia dataset, and the results have been classified with the standard machine learning techniques, transfer learning techniques and the proposed deep learning techniques leading to a total of twelve different classifiers and a comprehensive analysis is made in this work with very promising results in terms of classification accuracy reporting more than 95% for most of the proposed cases.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422002421","extra":"Citation Key: prabhakar2022improved","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"198","pages":"116783","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116783","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sunil Kumar","lastName":"Prabhakar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Seong-Whan","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Deep learning"},{"tag":"EEG"},{"tag":"Hybrid feature extraction"},{"tag":"Sparse representation"},{"tag":"Transfer learning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:12:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4FH2AV7U","itemID":1508,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933426,"version":0},"$loki":544},{"itemID":1470,"item":{"key":"5Y6VSQSP","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Experiment-based affect heuristic using fuzzy rules and Taguchi statistical method for tuning complex systems","abstractNote":"Affect heuristic is a subjective feeling that enables human's quick and efficient decision-making in unstructured and uncertain environments. It is an experience-based subconscious process in which information is framed for quick interpretation. Here, we propose a hybrid Experiment-based Decision-making architecture based on Affect Heuristics (EDAH) that uses possibility and probability theories in combination utilizing fuzzy logic's ability to address deterministic uncertainty and graduality of truth, along with Taguchi method's ability to exploit the statistical data as a robust and suboptimal experiment design methodology. Accordingly, the proposed paradigm aims to make the best decision from a set of feasible decisions using fewer experiments by inserting reliable subjective information by the expert in the random samples of experiments. The proposed method is mathematically defined and then applied to the problem of Targeted Drug Delivery (TDD) for cancer treatment in the two states of with and without noise. Furthermore, we study the effect of three membership functions, consisting of triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian forms on our decisions' selection for making an improved medical decision and avoiding an unprofitable one by recognizing existing opportunities. Results indicate considerable improvement of normoxic and hypoxic cell densities when compared with the competing approaches.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421000798","extra":"Citation Key: radyraz2021experimentbased","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"172","pages":"114638","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114638","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Nasibeh","lastName":"Rady Raz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad-R.","lastName":"Akbarzadeh-T.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Akbarzadeh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Affect heuristics"},{"tag":"Cognitive models"},{"tag":"Parameter learning"},{"tag":"Taguchi method"},{"tag":"Targeted drug delivery"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5Y6VSQSP","itemID":1470,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933452,"version":0},"$loki":552},{"itemID":1485,"item":{"key":"5ZQWHVQD","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fuzzy-soft set approach for ranking the functional requirements of software","abstractNote":"Software requirements are the need of the stakeholders which are determined by the requirements elicitation techniques.

This paper proposes a new multi-classification assessment model of personal credit risk based on the theory of information fusion (MIFCA) by using six machine learning algorithms. The MIFCA model can simultaneously integrate the advantages of multiple classifiers and reduce the interference of uncertain information. In order to verify the MIFCA model, dataset collected from a real data set of commercial bank in China. Experimental results show that MIFCA model has two outstanding points in various assessment criteria. One is that it has higher accuracy for multi-classification assessment, and the other is that it is suitable for various risk assessments and has universal applicability. In addition, the results of this research can also provide references for banks and other financial institutions to strengthen their risk prevention and control capabilities, improve their credit risk identification capabilities, and avoid financial losses.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421015475","extra":"Citation Key: wang2022multiclassification","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"191","pages":"116236","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116236","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Tianhui","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renjing","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Qi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"D-S evidence theory"},{"tag":"Information fusion"},{"tag":"Multi-classification assessment"},{"tag":"Personal credit risk"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/73KKLXJ8","itemID":1487,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933476,"version":0},"$loki":562},{"itemID":1231,"item":{"key":"7JNZ8VVY","version":5505,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A novel approach to multi-criteria group decision-making problems based on linguistic D numbers","date":"2020","extra":"Publisher: Springer\nCitation Key: liu2020novel","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"39","pages":"1–27","publicationTitle":"Computational and Applied Mathematics","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Computational and Applied Mathematics","creators":[{"firstName":"Peide","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T03:38:01Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7JNZ8VVY","itemID":1231,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933482,"version":0},"$loki":565},{"itemID":1221,"item":{"key":"88R23U2E","version":5504,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Maximum-entropy-based decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and its application in emergency management","date":"2022","extra":"Publisher: IGI Global\nCitation Key: che2022maximumentropybased","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"34","pages":"1–16","publicationTitle":"Journal of Organizational and End User Computing (JOEUC)","issue":"7","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Organizational and End User Computing (JOEUC)","creators":[{"firstName":"Yuelin","lastName":"Che","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yu-Hsi","lastName":"Yuan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:14:22Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/88R23U2E","itemID":1221,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933508,"version":0},"$loki":570},{"itemID":1244,"item":{"key":"8N73LI9J","version":5506,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Upper and lower probabilities induced by a multivalued mapping","date":"1967","extra":"Publisher: Institute of Mathematical Statistics\nCitation Key: ap1967upper","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"38","pages":"325–339","publicationTitle":"The Annals of Mathematical Statistics","issue":"2","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"The Annals of Mathematical Statistics","creators":[{"firstName":"Dempster","lastName":"AP","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T04:09:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/8N73LI9J","itemID":1244,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933513,"version":0},"$loki":573},{"itemID":1464,"item":{"key":"96PFLSUH","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Maximal association analysis using logical formulas over soft sets","abstractNote":"Discovering interesting and useful association rules from the collected data is an issue of great importance in pattern mining.

With the help of logical formulas over soft sets, all critical concepts for mining both regular and maximal association rules are incorporated into a common framework, and uniform mathematical characterizations of these concepts are provided accordingly. Three algorithms are also designed to develop a new approach to maximal association rule mining using logical formulas over soft sets. Moreover, we present two examples to show theoretical value of the obtained results and practical applicability of the proposed approach. The first example relies on a clinical diagnosis data set and illustrates the advantages of applying logical formula over soft sets to rule extraction.

Therefore, this paper combines several multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques with probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PHFLTSs) to implement risk assessment of failure modes by a panel of specialists. It aims at overcoming some defects existing in the conventional FMEA, such as without epistemic uncertainty and group risk assessment, as well as with some questions incurring from the risk priority number (RPN). Consequently, group members utilize PHFLTSs to express their subjective uncertain risk assessments on failure modes, in which the social network analysis (SNA) and maximizing consensus method (MCM) are exploited to derive the subjective and objective weights of group members respectively, afterwards their integrated weights are employed to aggregate individual risk assessments into the collective risk assessment. Additionally, the subjective and objective weights of risk factors are garnered by the best-worst method (BWM) and maximizing deviation method (MDM) separately, from which their integrated weights are incorporated into the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) so as to obtain the risk ranking of failure modes. Finally, an example with sensitive and comparative analyses is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421013609","extra":"Citation Key: wang2022group","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"188","pages":"116013","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116013","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhi-Chao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Genbao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Best-worst method"},{"tag":"Failure mode and effects analysis"},{"tag":"Multi-criteria decision making"},{"tag":"Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets"},{"tag":"Social network analysis"},{"tag":"TOPSIS"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AW2R9BSZ","itemID":1474,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933552,"version":0},"$loki":592},{"itemID":1217,"item":{"key":"B4R5FYGN","version":5504,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Entropy with respect to plausibility measures","date":"1982","extra":"Citation Key: hohle1982entropy","proceedingsTitle":"Proc. of 12th IEEE int.

Thus, this paper defines mass Jensen–Shannon divergence (MJSD) to reflect the conflict degree. MJSD considers both the external difference and the external difference of the mass function. Furthermore, this paper proposes an enhanced mass Jensen–Shannon divergence (EMJSD). EMJSD has all the advantages of MJSD. It is a distance-like measure, which satisfies some axiom of distance measure, such as non-negativity and symmetry. Compared with the current methods, EMJSD fully measures the internal and external difference between the mass functions. Therefore, EJMSD overcomes the drawbacks of the classical methods when measuring differences between mass functions. Some numerical examples are used to explain its properties and advantages. Additionally, this paper presents a new method to fuse multi-source information. A numerical example shows that this fusion method is more useful for decision-making under the framework of multi-source information fusion. We then construct a new generation method of mass function in the data-driven environment. The experimental results show that when compared with other method, the new generation method more accurately reflects the support degree of proposition. Finally, this paper applies the generated mass functions to the new fusion method and other methods. The results indicate that the new fusion method has better recognition performance in practical applications.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422012702","extra":"Citation Key: pan2022enhanced","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"209","pages":"118065","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118065","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaozhuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kang Hao","lastName":"Cheong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Conflict"},{"tag":"Enhanced mass Jensen–Shannon divergence"},{"tag":"Information fusion"},{"tag":"Mass function"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BU9ZBPJP","itemID":1468,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933560,"version":0},"$loki":599},{"itemID":1355,"item":{"key":"C5WU2KZ5","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A fuzzy extension of Saaty's priority theory","date":"1983","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: 1983fuzzy","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"11","pages":"229–241","publicationTitle":"Fuzzy Sets and Systems.

However, traditional model-free methods suffer from the expensive computational cost of evaluating networks; almost all the research on Bayesian optimization is aimed at optimizing the objective functions with vectorial inputs, e.g., the hyper-parameters in any expert systems. This work focuses on applying Bayesian optimization to optimize network structure with graph-structured inputs, and presents a flexible framework, denoted as graph Bayesian optimization (GBO), to handle arbitrary graphs. By combining the proposed framework with graph kernels, it can take full advantage of implicit graph structural features to supplement explicit features guessed according to the experience, such as tags of nodes and any attributes of graphs. Simultaneously, the proposed framework can identify which features are more important during the optimization process. By collaboratively working with a down-stream decision tree, the GBO can not only find the optimum but also discover its knowledge represented by rules, which can further enhance its interpretability and assist expert decision-making. A novel problem of opening the gated residential areas is presented in this work, which can serve as one benchmark task of road network design. Intensive experiments conducted on three real-world applications, including robust network design, the most active node identification, and urban transportation network design, demonstrate its efficacy and potential applications.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420311684","extra":"Citation Key: cui2021novel","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"170","pages":"114524","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114524","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiaxu","lastName":"Cui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Tan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chunxu","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian optimization"},{"tag":"Graph kernels"},{"tag":"Graphs"},{"tag":"Networks"},{"tag":"Structure optimization"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/E5RF967F","itemID":1463,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933593,"version":0},"$loki":615},{"itemID":1476,"item":{"key":"EK7ZX4BD","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Probabilistic modeling approach for interpretable inference and prediction with data for sepsis diagnosis","abstractNote":"Sepsis is a serious disease that can cause death. It is important to predict sepsis within the early stages after the presence of sepsis symptoms. In this paper, a new probabilistic modeling approach is used to establish classifiers for sepsis diagnosis. This approach is characterized by unique strong interpretability, which is reflected in three aspects: (1) evidence acquisition based on likelihood analysis, (2) probabilistic rule-based inference, and (3) parameters optimization using machine learning algorithms. Four-fold cross-validation is used to train and validate classifiers established by the new approach and alternative ones. Results show that in terms of classification capability, the classifier established by the new approach generally performs better than the majority of alternative classifiers for sepsis diagnosis, and close to the best one. As the classifier also features an inherent interpretability, it can be used as a tool for supporting diagnostic decision-making in sepsis diagnosis.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421007624","extra":"Citation Key: yao2021probabilistic","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"183","pages":"115333","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115333","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shuaiyu","lastName":"Yao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong-Ling","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Dark","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Interpretability"},{"tag":"Maximum likelihood evidential reasoning framework"},{"tag":"Probabilistic modeling"},{"tag":"Rule-based inference"},{"tag":"Sepsis diagnosis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/EK7ZX4BD","itemID":1476,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933622,"version":0},"$loki":618},{"itemID":1478,"item":{"key":"F6A6DD3Z","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"New fusion frameworks including explicit weighting functions for the remaining useful life prognostics","abstractNote":"In the last recent years, a large community of researchers and industrial practitioners has been attracted by combining different prognostics models as such strategy results in boosted accuracy and robust performance compared to the exploitation of single models.

These integrated frameworks are based on aggregating a set of Gaussian process regression models thanks to the Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging Operators. The combination procedure is built upon three proposed analytical weighting schemes including exponential, logarithmic and inverse functions. In addition, the uncertainty aspect is supported in this work, where the proposed functions are used to weighted average the variances released from competitive Gaussian process regression models. The training data are transformed into gradient values, which are adopted as new training data instead of the original observations. A lithium-ion battery data set is used as a benchmark to prove the efficiency of the proposed weighting schemes.

First, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that emulates the decision-making ability of a botanist expert in the recognition of tree species from their leaves and bark. The main challenges of this recognition problem are related to the high diversity of trees in nature, the interspecies similarity and the intra-species variability. Therefore, similarities between species cause several confusions during recognition. The proposed decision system is designed to solve this complex problem of tree species recognition by reasoning with knowledge sets where the inference engine is based on belief functions theory, which reduces confusion between species and achieves greater accuracy. Secondly, this paper proposes a practical solution that can be embedded in the user's smartphone without any need for an internet connection. Therefore, our approach is adapted for smartphone limits, i.e. limits related to memory and computation capacity. Once in nature, everybody should appreciate the idea of having a mobile application that reflects the skills and know-how of a botanist. Building an application to make the potential of tree species recognition accessible and easy to use is a challenging problem. From methodological perspectives, the suggested method is a two-step recognition approach that identifies the leaf in a first step and refines the results using the bark in the second step. In fact, the first step is used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem through the identification of a subset of most probable species. The second step is performed using a modified evidential k Nearest Neighbors (EkNN) algorithm that recognizes the bark from the output of the first step. A set of experiments on real-world data is presented in order to study the accuracy of the proposed solution against existing ones.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419308711","extra":"Citation Key: jendoubi2020evidential","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"146","pages":"113154","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113154","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Siwar","lastName":"Jendoubi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Coquin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Reda","lastName":"Boukezzoula","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"k nearest neighbors"},{"tag":"Mass estimation"},{"tag":"Theory of belief functions"},{"tag":"Tree species recognition"},{"tag":"Two-step classification"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IJVF87DD","itemID":1482,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933681,"version":0},"$loki":647},{"itemID":1479,"item":{"key":"J2F4YZ9X","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DPT: An importance-based decision probability transformation method for uncertain belief in evidence theory","abstractNote":"Dempster–Shafer evidence theory can combine multiple sources of uncertain information to form a consistent basic probability assignment (BPA).

In this method, the importance weight is introduced into the belief interval for the first time, and then the importance is used to define the information volume and superiority degree, so that more reliable decisions can be achieved through the trade-off between conservative and aggressive. Comparative experiments on numerical examples and applications show that the proposed DPT method can weigh the aggressiveness of decisions, and its decision probability transformation behavior is the most rational and its application performance is the most reliable.

site selection for the automotive industry using a fermatean fuzzy-based decision-making approach","abstractNote":"The automotive industry is one of the most competitive sectors, and it requires a well-structured logistics system to meet the industry' vital requirements such as just-in-time, lean and agile supply chain operations, productivity and sustainability. Well-located and well-designed warehouses can make reaching these aims for the automotive industry possible and more accessible. Hence, determining a location for a warehouse is a highly critical, tactical, and managerial resolution for the automotive industry, as there is a strong correlation between well-located warehouses and the well-structured logistics network in the automotive industry. Although the WSS is a significant decision-making problem, we observed four critical and severe gaps in the existing literature: (1) the authors preferred to apply traditional objective & subjective frames, and they overlooked existing highly complicated uncertainties. (2) The number of studies focusing on the WSS problem in the automotive industry is surprisingly scarce. (3) It is not sufficiently clear how these factors used in the previous studies were determined, which causes doubts about their reliability. (4) there is no satisfactory evidence of which approaches were used to identify the factors in the previous papers. By considering these gaps, we propose two approaches which can be accepted as a novelty of the paper. First is the extension of the Delphi techniques based on the Fermetean fuzzy sets (FFs) used for identifying the criteria. It also combines the two traditional approaches (i.e., literature review and professionals' evaluations to identify the criteria) with the FF-Delphi technique. The second is the Double Normalized MARCOS approach based on FFs (FF- DN MARCOS) implemented to identify the weights of the criteria and ranking performance of the alternatives. The proposed model was implemented to identify the best warehouse location for the automotive manufacturing company. The results show that the C1 “energy availability & cost” criterion is the most influential criterion and the C5 proximity to port and customs criterion is the second most crucial factor. Then we executed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, and the results approved the suggested model's validity and robustness despite excessive modifications in the criteria weights.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422015809","extra":"Citation Key: saha2023warehouse","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"211","pages":"118497","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118497","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Saha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamucar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Omer F.","lastName":"Gorcun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arunodaya","lastName":"Raj Mishra","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"double normalized MARCOS"},{"tag":"The automotive industry"},{"tag":"the Fermatean fuzzy sets"},{"tag":"Warehouse site selection"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/MC2J7MH3","itemID":1514,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933784,"version":0},"$loki":676},{"itemID":1516,"item":{"key":"N4IKJ4CW","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fault Matters: Sensor data fusion for detection of faults using Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence in IoT-based applications","abstractNote":"Fault detection in sensor nodes is a pertinent issue that has been an important area of research for a very long time. But it is not explored much as yet in the context of Internet of Things. Internet of Things work with a massive amount of data so the responsibility for guaranteeing the accuracy of the data also lies with it. Moreover, a lot of important and critical decisions are made based on these data, so ensuring its correctness and accuracy is also very important. Also, the detection needs to be as precise as possible to avoid negative alerts. For this purpose, this work has adopted Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence to collate the information from sensors to come up with a decision regarding the faulty status of a sensor node from a data-centric perspective. To verify the validity of the proposed method, simulations have been performed on a benchmark data set and data collected through a test bed in a laboratory set-up. For the different types of faults, the proposed method shows very high accuracy for both the benchmark (99.8%) and laboratory data sets (99.9%) when compared to the other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306898","extra":"Citation Key: ghosh2020fault","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"162","pages":"113887","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113887","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Nimisha","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rourab","lastName":"Paul","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Maity","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krishanu","lastName":"Maity","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sayantan","lastName":"Saha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Data fusion"},{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer"},{"tag":"Fault detection"},{"tag":"Internet of Things (IoT)"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/N4IKJ4CW","itemID":1516,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933796,"version":0},"$loki":682},{"itemID":1246,"item":{"key":"N8THZUIE","version":5507,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A mathematical theory of communication","date":"1948","extra":"Publisher: Nokia Bell Labs\nCitation Key: shannon1948mathematical","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"27","pages":"379–423","publicationTitle":"The Bell system technical journal","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"The Bell system technical journal","creators":[{"firstName":"Claude E","lastName":"Shannon","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T15:21:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/N8THZUIE","itemID":1246,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933799,"version":0},"$loki":684},{"itemID":1477,"item":{"key":"NDJD9L7J","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Cautious weighted random forests","abstractNote":"Random forest is an efficient and accurate classification model, which makes decisions by aggregating a set of trees, either by voting or by averaging class posterior probability estimates. However, tree outputs may be unreliable in presence of scarce data. The imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM) provides workaround, by replacing point probability estimates with interval-valued ones. This paper investigates a new tree aggregation method based on the theory of belief functions to combine such probability intervals, resulting in a cautious random forest classifier. In particular, we propose a strategy for computing tree weights based on the minimization of a convex cost function, which takes both determinacy and accuracy into account and makes it possible to adjust the level of cautiousness of the model. The proposed model is evaluated on 25 UCI datasets and is demonstrated to be more adaptive to the noise in training data and to achieve a better compromise between informativeness and cautiousness.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422019017","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2023cautious","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"213","pages":"118883","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118883","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Haifei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Quost","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-Hélène","lastName":"Masson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief functions"},{"tag":"Cautious classification"},{"tag":"Imprecise classification"},{"tag":"Imprecise dirichlet model"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NDJD9L7J","itemID":1477,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933802,"version":0},"$loki":686},{"itemID":1233,"item":{"key":"PDLRU57M","version":5505,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A vector and geometry interpretation of basic probability assignment in Dempster-Shafer theory","date":"2020","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能2区","callNumber":"8.9924","rights":"8.9264","extra":"Publisher: Wiley Online Library\nCitation Key: luo2020vector","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"35","pages":"944–962","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Intell Syst","creators":[{"firstName":"Ziyuan","lastName":"Luo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T03:47:42Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/PDLRU57M","itemID":1233,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933814,"version":0},"$loki":695},{"itemID":1232,"item":{"key":"PNDKMN8Z","version":5505,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Derive knowledge of Z-number from the perspective of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory","date":"2019","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术2区","libraryCatalog":"自动化与控制系统3区  计算机：人工智能3区  工程：电子与电气2区  工程：综合2区","callNumber":"7.8024","rights":"6.6936","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: liu2019derive","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"85","pages":"754–764","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Eng Appl Artif Intel","creators":[{"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Tian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bingyi","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T03:47:17Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/PNDKMN8Z","itemID":1232,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933816,"version":0},"$loki":696},{"itemID":1513,"item":{"key":"Q6H4EBGQ","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Harnessing heterogeneous social networks for better recommendations: A grey relational analysis approach","abstractNote":"Most of the extant studies in social recommender system are based on explicit social relationships, while the potential of implicit relationships in the heterogeneous social networks remains largely unexplored. This study proposes a new approach to designing a recommender system by employing grey relational analysis on the heterogeneous social networks. It starts with the establishment of heterogeneous social networks through the user-item bipartite graph, user social network graph and user-attribute bipartite graph; and then uses grey relational analysis to identify implicit social relationships, which are then incorporated into the matrix factorization model. Five experiments were conducted to test the performance of our approach against four state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results show that compared with the baseline methods, our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem, because the heterogeneous social network provides richer information. In addition, the grey relational analysis method has the advantage of low requirements for data size and efficiently relieves the cold start problem. Furthermore, our approach saves processing time, thus increases recommendation efficiency. Overall, the proposed approach can effectively improve the accuracy of rating prediction in social recommendations and provide accurate and efficient recommendation service for users.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421002128","extra":"Citation Key: weng2021harnessing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"174","pages":"114771","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114771","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Weng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qishan","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Grey relational analysis"},{"tag":"Heterogeneous social network"},{"tag":"Implicit social relationships"},{"tag":"Recommendation algorithm"},{"tag":"Recommender system"},{"tag":"User profile"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Q6H4EBGQ","itemID":1513,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933826,"version":0},"$loki":701},{"itemID":1472,"item":{"key":"QKIV3JW2","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Combined ensemble multi-class SVM and fuzzy NSGA-II for trend forecasting and trading in Forex markets","abstractNote":"Foreign exchange (Forex) market is the biggest currency exchange market in the world. Existing trading systems in Forex markets based on technical analysis use crisp technical indicators to provide Buy/Sell signals to the trader, only when the indicator value crosses a given threshold level. This strict and noise-sensitive condition can be replaced through uncertainty handling of indicators using fuzzy numbers to generate Buy/Sell signals with fuzzy memberships functions. To achieve this purpose, this paper presents a combined technique based on ensemble multi-class support vector machine (EmcSVM) and fuzzy NSGA-II for efficient trend classification and trading in Forex markets. At first, EmcSVM is used to forecast and classify the future market trend into uptrend, sideway, and downtrend. Then, NSGA-II is applied to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed fuzzy trading system comprising multiple AND-OR Buy/Sell technical rules for uptrend/downtrend markets. The hyperparameters include indicator selection within each rule, importance weights of the different rules, and final decision thresholds for Buy/Sell models, while the objective is to maximize average return on investment (ROI) and minimize average draw-down of all transactions. The proposed method has been successfully developed and tested on real data from the Forex market for EUR/USD currency pair in a 6-year timeframe from 2014 to 2019. Obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing crisp trading systems, with 80.8% precision, 72.4% recall, 94.1% annual ROI, and 0.58% draw down.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009726","extra":"Citation Key: sadeghi2021combined","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"185","pages":"115566","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115566","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sadeghi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Daneshvar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Madanchi Zaj","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ensemble learning"},{"tag":"Forex market"},{"tag":"Fuzzy logic"},{"tag":"NSGA-II"},{"tag":"Technical analysis"},{"tag":"Trend classification"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QKIV3JW2","itemID":1472,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933850,"version":0},"$loki":705},{"itemID":1475,"item":{"key":"R4YN3E4Y","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multi-stage and multi-topology analysis of ship traffic complexity for probabilistic collision detection","abstractNote":"Maritime traffic situational awareness plays a vital role in the development of intelligent transportation-support systems. The state-of-the-art study focuses on near-miss collision risk between/among ships but reveals challenges in estimating large-scale traffic situations associated with dynamic and uncertain ship motions at a regional level. This study develops a systematic methodology to evaluate ship traffic complexity to comprehend the traffic situation in complex waters. In the new methodology, the topological and evolutionary characteristics of ship traffic networks and the uncertainty in ship movements are considered simultaneously to realise probabilistic collision detection. The methodology, through the effective integration of probabilistic conflict estimation and traffic complexity modelling and assessment, enables the evaluation of traffic complexity in a fine-grained hierarchical manner. With the AIS-based trajectory data collected from the world’s largest port (i.e. Ningbo-Zhoushan Port), a thorough validation of the evaluation performance is conducted and demonstrated through scenario analysis and model robustness. Moreover, some critical research results are obtained in terms of traffic network heterogeneity analysis; statistics including occurrence frequency, temporal distribution, life cycle, and transition probability of traffic complexity patterns; and correlation examination between the number of ships and traffic complexity patterns. These findings offer new insights into improving maritime traffic awareness capabilities and promoting maritime traffic safety

and entropy: Effectual knowledge management equipment for learning organizations","abstractNote":"The present paper aims to put forward negation and entropy as novel perspectives for knowledge management in learning organizations. The present work considers the surrounding factors of information to enumerate the effectiveness of information in the knowledge management field. Moreover, by utilizing the effectiveness of surrounding factors, a framework inspired by Dempster-Shafer theory has been presented to generate negation. Finally, the present paper defines and calculates entropy for information. We have applied negation and entropy concepts to two well-known cases of organizational systems and management domains to study their impact on the knowledge management domain.

One of the main advantages of the first approach is its greater accuracy and wider generality for the application of the methods developed which can be used in various scenarios. By contrast, expert systems are usually more restricted and often applicable only to the domain for which they were originally developed. However, the machine learning approach requires the availability of large chunks of data, and it is much more complicated to interpret the results of the statistical methods to obtain some explanation of why the system decides, classifies, or evaluates a situation in a certain way. This issue may become very important in areas such as medicine, where it is relevant to know why the system recommends a certain treatment or diagnoses a certain illness. Likewise, in the financial sector, it might be legally required to explain that a decision to reject the granting of a mortgage loan to a person is not due to discriminatory causes such as gender or race. In order to be able to have interpretability and extract knowledge of available data we developed a classification method based on Dempster-Shafer’s Plausibility Theory. Mass assignment functions (MAF) must be established to apply this theory and they assign a weight or probability to all subsets of the possible outcomes, given the presence of a certain fact on a decision scenario. Thus MAF assignments encode expert knowledge. The method learns optimal values for the weights of each MAF using the Gradient Descent method. The presented method allows combination of MAF which have been generated by the method itself or defined by an expert with those that are derived from a set of available data. The developed method was first applied to controlled scenarios and traditional data sets to ensure that classifications and explanations are correct. Results show that the model can classify with an accuracy which is comparable to other statistical classification methods, being also able to extract the most important decision rules from the data.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420300877","extra":"Citation Key: penafiel2020applying","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"148","pages":"113262","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113262","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Peñafiel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Baloian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Horacio","lastName":"Sanson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José A.","lastName":"Pino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Expert systems"},{"tag":"Gradient descent"},{"tag":"Interpretability"},{"tag":"Supervised learning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/X8HW2N74","itemID":1466,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933962,"version":0},"$loki":759},{"itemID":1346,"item":{"key":"XKNRM5SX","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A generalized belief entropy with nonspecificity and structural conflict","date":"2022","extra":"Citation Key: zhou2022generalized","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"52","pages":"5532-5545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TSMC.2021.3129872","issue":"9","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Mi","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shan-Shan","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yu-Wang","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Herrera-Viedma","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-04T06:41:41Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XKNRM5SX","itemID":1346,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933967,"version":0},"$loki":762},{"itemID":1471,"item":{"key":"XWFY5GPP","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Predicting tweet impact using a novel evidential reasoning prediction method","abstractNote":"This study presents a novel evidential reasoning (ER) prediction model called MAKER-RIMER to examine how different features embedded in Twitter posts (tweets) can predict the number of retweets achieved during an electoral campaign. The tweets posted by the two most voted candidates during the official campaign for the 2017 Ecuadorian Presidential election were used for this research. For each tweet, five features including type of tweet, emotion, URL, hashtag, and date are identified and coded to predict if tweets are of either high or low impact. The main contributions of the new proposed model include its suitability to analyse tweet datasets based on likelihood analysis of data. The model is interpretable, and the prediction process relies only on the use of available data. The experimental results show that MAKER-RIMER performed better, in terms of misclassification error, when compared against other predictive machine learning approaches. In addition, the model allows observing which features of the candidates’ tweets are linked to high and low impact. Tweets containing allusions to the contender candidate, either with positive or negative connotations, without hashtags, and written towards the end of the campaign, were persistently those with the highest impact. URLs, on the other hand, is the only variable that performs differently for the two candidates in terms of achieving high impact. MAKER-RIMER can provide campaigners of political parties or candidates with a tool to measure how features of tweets are predictors of their impact, which can be useful to tailor Twitter content during electoral campaigns.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420310721","extra":"Citation Key: rivadeneira2021predicting","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"169","pages":"114400","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114400","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lucía","lastName":"Rivadeneira","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"López-Ibáñez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief rule-based inference"},{"tag":"Evidential reasoning rule"},{"tag":"Maximum likelihood data analysis"},{"tag":"Prediction"},{"tag":"Retweet"},{"tag":"Twitter"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XWFY5GPP","itemID":1471,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349933970,"version":0},"$loki":764},{"itemID":1345,"item":{"key":"YF6BDZRG","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Belief entropy-of-entropy and its application in the cardiac interbeat interval time series analysis","abstractNote":"How to measure the complexity of physiological signals in biological system is an open problem.

In complex multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), how to rank TFNs and get the best alternative from MAGDM are two important issues. Existing ranking methods of TFNs only consider the minimum value, the maximum value and the most likely value, which ignores the other possible values. To avoid the limitation, the preference degree of TFNs is defined combining the probability with possibility of TFN, which considers all the possible values in TFN. Then a preference degree based algorithm is designed to rank TFNs. Furthermore, the triangular fuzzy MAGDM is investigated. Considering the group consensus of DMs, the attitude-based individual consensus index of DM is defined and applied to determine DMs’ weights. The attribute weights are obtained by the comprehensive utility ratings of alternatives with a control parameter. Thus, a new method is proposed to solve triangular fuzzy MAGDM problem. Finally, a public experience evaluation in new smart city is applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAGDM method.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421004231","extra":"Citation Key: wang2021preference","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"178","pages":"114982","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114982","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Attitude-based consensus index"},{"tag":"Multi-attribute group decision making"},{"tag":"Preference degree"},{"tag":"Triangular fuzzy number"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZWNK4MKI","itemID":1473,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349934003,"version":0},"$loki":780},{"itemID":1467,"item":{"key":"XHTJJ444","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evaluation of fuzzy membership functions for linguistic rule-based classifier focused on explainability, interpretability and reliability","abstractNote":"Objective: Decision support systems focus on their interpretability with a different caution. The majority of approaches utilize reliable optimization techniques to achieve high recognition accuracy. However, accuracy improvement is done at the cost of the readability of the decision support system. This paper proposes a novel technique of linguistic rule extraction focused on: explainability, interpretability, and reliability, called EasIeR. Methods: Proposed solution performs a direct analysis of the learning set without omitting real data imperfections. The proposed algorithm processes the imprecision of data with linguistic values described by fuzzy membership functions and the uncertainty of knowledge employing a fuzzy belief function. It describes the learning set with the most appropriate fuzzy if-then rules. For this purpose, a new method of evaluation of membership functions in a set of rules and their iterative refinement is proposed. Results: EasIeR achieves the best results of trade-off criteria between the generalization quality and the interpretability of the knowledge base when compared with state-of-art fuzzy rule-based classification approaches. Achieving the simplest rule base and competitive generalization quality is verified by cross-validation experiments with benchmark data sets. Significance: The new method of rule evaluation allows for better determination of their quality in decision support, and the selection algorithm quickly provides a clear and easy to interpret knowledge base. This rule evaluation technique will be proficient for all fuzzy rule-based classification systems.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005164","extra":"Citation Key: porebski2022evaluation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"199","pages":"117116","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117116","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Porebski","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Explainable decision support"},{"tag":"Fuzzy belief function"},{"tag":"Interpretable classification"},{"tag":"Membership function evaluation"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:12:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XHTJJ444","itemID":1467,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349935506,"version":0},"$loki":781},{"itemID":1509,"item":{"key":"KIDXJPMN","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Novel weighted ensemble classifier for smartphone based indoor localization","abstractNote":"Indoor localization systems have the capability to change the way of providing location-based services in a closed environment. Though there is no agreed-upon technology that works best in indoor, WiFi signal is an important alternative as most of such places are covered by WiFi Access Points (APs). In this paper, the problem of indoor localization is investigated from the perspective of expert systems through applying machine learning techniques. The significant variation of WiFi signal strength with ambient conditions as well as device configuration badly affects the localization accuracy. Thus, the fingerprinting effort required to train a localization system subject to context heterogeneity is huge. The uncertainty in localization performance due to varying contexts is hardly investigated in the literature. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a weighted ensemble classifier based on Dempster–Shafer belief theory to efficiently handle context heterogeneity. Here, the context is defined in terms of different smartphone configurations used for training and testing the system as well as temporal variation of signals. The method presented here utilizes the Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions to calculate the weights of the base learners in the decision of the ensemble. Belief theory is applied here to handle the inherent uncertainty in WiFi signal variations due to heterogeneous context. Real life experiments are conducted for two datasets, JUIndoorLoc and UJIIndoorLoc at different granularity levels. For JUIndoorLoc, with state-of-the-art classifiers, 86–97% accuracy can be achieved for 10-fold cross-validation. However, when the training context differs from the test conditions, accuracy drops to 62–87%. In such a scenario, the proposed weighted ensemble technique is found to achieve almost 98% localization accuracy when RSSIs, mean and variance of RSSIs are considered as features. The technique can lead to an effective expert system for indoor localization at varying granularity levels. Such systems would be beneficial for pervasive indoor positioning applications as no dedicated infrastructure is needed for positioning.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420305820","extra":"Citation Key: roy2021novel","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"164","pages":"113758","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113758","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Priya","lastName":"Roy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chandreyee","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mausam","lastName":"Kundu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dip","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sanghamitra","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer belief theory"},{"tag":"Ensemble"},{"tag":"Indoor localization"},{"tag":"RSSI"},{"tag":"WiFi"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:12:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KIDXJPMN","itemID":1509,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683349943877,"version":0},"$loki":782},{"itemID":1511,"item":{"key":"CD8N26DR","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Matching contrastive learning: An effective and intelligent method for wind turbine fault diagnosis with imbalanced SCADA data","abstractNote":"Data-driven intelligent systems provide a possible solution to condition-based maintenance of wind turbines without experts’ knowledge or mechanism models. However, the accuracy of fault diagnosis results is easily impaired by the data imbalance in real-world applications. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to address the mentioned problem. Specifically, spatial and temporal information of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data is extracted, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to obtain the data representations correlated with the health conditions. Additionally, the bollards of the data distributions are determined in the representation space, and they are matched with the data centers of each health state. Under this circumstance, the unexpected effects of data imbalance on data representations are relieved, leading to effective decision boundaries regardless of the sample numbers. Then, a classifier is trained on the learned representations to recognize the faults in wind turbines. Compared with several baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, the impressive performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulated data and actual measurements from a utility-scale wind turbine. This research provides useful insights into the efficient development of wind energy with data-driven intelligent systems.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423003925","extra":"Citation Key: sun2023matching","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"223","pages":"119891","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119891","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shilin","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenyang","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuekai","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianyang","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fulei","lastName":"Chu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Artificial intelligence"},{"tag":"Fault diagnosis"},{"tag":"Operation and maintenance"},{"tag":"Wind turbine"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:13:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CD8N26DR","itemID":1511,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350007123,"version":0},"$loki":805},{"itemID":1510,"item":{"key":"IP4F4HSX","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Recognize the surrounding: Development and evaluation of convolutional deep networks using gammatone spectrograms and raw audio signals","abstractNote":"Environmental sound (ES) consists of the surrounding sounds around us. The classification of this kind of sound has specific and significant contributions in many modern world applications, especially in the internet of things (IoT). However, accurately predicting the sound class of an ES is difficult because of the uncertain pattern in most cases. Although a lot of research has been done to develop a fully accurate environmental sound classification (ESC) system using different extracted features from signal, feature selection and classifier design is still a harsh job and sometimes does not guarantee a precise result. In recent years, ESC has attracted the attention of the research community because of the breakthrough in learning algorithms. Following this trend, a study is carried out here to find and propose two CNN models, 1D and 2D, for raw signal input and Gammatone spectrogram input, respectively. Compared with 2D CNN model, 1D CNN for time series waveform is a recent idea. Assessing the models on two various datasets (ESC-10 and US-8 K), the overall accuracy for 2D CNN is found 80.2% (ESC-10), 89% (US-8 K). For 1D CNN, the accuracy is 80.4% (ESC-10), 86% (US-8 K). The performance of the proposed 1D CNN model is almost similar to that of the proposed 2D CNN model. Effective data augmentation procedure is done to achieve this high accuracy by introducing variability in the given dataset, and to reduce overfitting. Finally, the proposed models have a minimal number of parameters to be trained, and floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) are also minimal, especially for 1D CNN.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422004171","extra":"Citation Key: sengupta2022recognize","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"200","pages":"116998","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116998","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Sen Gupta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shifat","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ki-Doo","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"CNN"},{"tag":"Environmental sound"},{"tag":"Gammatone"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:13:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IP4F4HSX","itemID":1510,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350007219,"version":0},"$loki":819},{"itemID":1223,"item":{"key":"4WHWJL45","version":5504,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Uncertainty measure in evidence theory with its applications","date":"2018","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能3区","callNumber":"5.0187","rights":"4.7603","extra":"Publisher: Springer\nCitation Key: wang2018uncertainty","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"48","pages":"1672–1688","publicationTitle":"Applied Intelligence","issue":"7","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Intell","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:37:51Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4WHWJL45","itemID":1223,"attachments":[{"key":"BUFKZDC9","version":6146,"itemType":"attachment","title":"wang_song_2018_uncertainty_measure_in_evidence_theory_with_its_applications.pdf","parentItem":"4WHWJL45","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2018/wang_song_2018_uncertainty_measure_in_evidence_theory_with_its_applications.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

In sensor networks, in collaborative health or genomic projects, in credit risk analysis, among other domains, distinct features are collected from multiple sources, including the use of social media and mobile applications, and due to privacy concerns or communication costs, may not be shared among sites. This scenario of vertical data partitioning poses challenges to traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, as classical algorithms are designed to learn from the complete set of features. A common strategy is to combine predictions from local models trained at each site into a global model, and for this purpose, several aggregation methods have been proposed. In this work we tackle a gap within the related literature, performing a comparative evaluation of elementary and meta-learning-based aggregation methods to reveal their strengths and weakness for 46 datasets with varied characteristics. We show that no method outperforms its counterparts in all domains, emphasizing the need for experimental comparison to ensure a good choice in the domain of interest. Moreover, our experiments provide the first insights into the relations between datasets’ properties and aggregators’ performance. We show that for low class imbalance and a good instance-to-feature ratio, almost all aggregation methods tend to perform well. The silhouette coefficient (reflecting class separability) and class imbalance coefficient are the most influential properties on aggregators’ performance, thus we recommend their analysis in the first step of the methodological design. We found that arithmetic-based methods are not suitable for datasets with poor class separability and a large number of classes, whereas meta-learning approaches are less sensitive for datasets with silhouette coefficient close to 0. Our analyses were summarized as classification and regression trees, which have the impact to serve as practical tools for future research. Taken together, our findings give rise to interesting applications in the domain of intelligent systems, especially regarding their potential to reduce the burden of vast experimental comparisons when training ML models with feature-partitioned data.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742030230X","extra":"Citation Key: trevizan2020comparative","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"152","pages":"113406","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113406","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Bernardo","lastName":"Trevizan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Chamby-Diaz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ana L.C.","lastName":"Bazzan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Recamonde-Mendoza","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Attribute-partitioned data"},{"tag":"Distributed machine learning"},{"tag":"Predictions aggregation"},{"tag":"Vertical data partitioning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:13:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/H87K3C5R","itemID":1512,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350052626,"version":0},"$loki":895},{"itemID":24,"item":{"key":"2L7NULW5","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Belief function combination and conflict management","abstractNote":"Within the framework of evidence theory, data fusion consists in obtaining a single belief function by the combination of several belief functions resulting from distinct information sources. The most popular rule of combination, called Dempster’s rule of combination (or the orthogonal sum), has several interesting mathematical properties such as commutativity or associativity. However, combining belief functions with this operator implies normalizing the results by scaling them proportionally to the conﬂicting mass in order to keep some basic properties. Although this normalization seems logical, several authors have criticized it and some have proposed other solutions. In particular, Dempster’s combination operator is a poor solution for the management of the conﬂict between the various information sources at the normalization step. Conﬂict management is a major problem especially during the fusion of many information sources. Indeed, the conﬂict increases with the number of information sources. That is why a strategy for re-assigning the conﬂicting mass is essential. In this paper, we deﬁne a formalism to describe a family of combination operators. So, we propose to develop a generic framework in order to unify several classical rules of combination. We also propose other combination rules allowing an arbitrary or adapted assignment of the conﬂicting mass to subsets. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A degraded image can actually be seen as a superimposition of a clear image with the same color imaging environment (underwater, sand or haze, etc.). Mathematically, we can introduce a rank-one matrix to characterize this phenomenon, i.e., rank-one prior (ROP). Using the prior, a direct method with the complexity O(N ) is derived for real-time recovery. For general cases, we develop ROP+ to further improve the recovery performance. Comprehensive experiments of the scene recovery illustrate that our method outperforms competitively several state-of-the-art imaging methods in terms of efﬁciency and robustness.","date":"2023","language":"en","shortTitle":"Rank-One Prior","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能1区  工程：电子与电气1区","callNumber":"24.3134","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969127/","accessDate":"2023-04-04T09:24:29Z","rights":"25.6515","extra":"Citation Key: liu2023rankone","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"1-17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3226276","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Ieee T Pattern Anal","ISSN":"0162-8828, 2160-9292, 1939-3539","creators":[{"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryan Wen","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianing","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tieyong","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-04T09:24:29Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AZQIWENR","itemID":1359,"attachments":[{"key":"QDTLVJPN","version":6133,"itemType":"attachment","title":"liu_et_al_2023_rank-one_prior.pdf","parentItem":"AZQIWENR","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2023/liu_et_al_2023_rank-one_prior.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:44:20Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:44:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QDTLVJPN","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2023\\liu_et_al_2023_rank-one_prior.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1636/liu_et_al_2023_rank-one_prior.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350060607,"version":0},"$loki":927},{"itemID":1330,"item":{"key":"BIEXECE2","version":5508,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Belief entropy rate: a method to measure the uncertainty of interval-valued stochastic processes","abstractNote":"Entropy rate, as an effective tool in information theory, can measure the uncertainty of stochastic processes modeled by probability mass function. However, when the stochastic process to be measured cannot be accurately modeled, i.e., it is more sense to describe the phenomenon with an interval, the stochastic process needs a more general method to represent. In this paper, the interval-valued stochastic process is modeled with the basic belief assignment in an ordered frame of discernment and the corresponding belief entropy rate is proposed to measure its uncertainty. Two common stochastic processes are discussed. The first is the case of independent identically distributed stochastic processes, where the belief entropy rate is formally the same as the Shannon entropy rate. The second is Markov processes. We construct the evidential Markov chain and calculate its belief entropy rate. Compared with the Shannon entropy rate, the belief entropy rate is easier to implement the Markov chains. By validating in real dataset, the proposed method can better deal with interval information with stronger practicability. When encountering tiny disturbances, the variance of the Shannon entropy rate is more than 50 times the variance of the belief entropy rate, which reflects the stronger robustness of the belief entropy rate.","date":"2023-01-05","language":"en","shortTitle":"Belief entropy rate","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能3区","callNumber":"5.0187","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10489-022-04407-1","accessDate":"2023-03-30T07:46:04Z","rights":"4.7603","extra":"Citation Key: wang2023belief","seriesTitle":"无","publicationTitle":"Applied Intelligence","DOI":"10.1007/s10489-022-04407-1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Intell","ISSN":"0924-669X, 1573-7497","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T07:46:04Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BIEXECE2","itemID":1330,"attachments":[{"key":"D776Y4J7","version":6133,"itemType":"attachment","title":"wang_et_al_2023_belief_entropy_rate.pdf","parentItem":"BIEXECE2","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2023/wang_et_al_2023_belief_entropy_rate.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-highdeﬁnition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The ﬁrst CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then ﬁts locallyafﬁne models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the highquality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks.","date":"6/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578433/","accessDate":"2023-03-30T08:04:23Z","extra":"Citation Key: zheng2021ultrahighdefinition","place":"Nashville, TN, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-66544-509-2","pages":"16180-16189","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01592","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhuoran","lastName":"Zheng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenqi","lastName":"Ren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fenglong","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiuyi","lastName":"Jia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:24Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/K3LC4X62","itemID":1337,"attachments":[{"key":"U4XK69TX","version":6134,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zheng_et_al_2021_ultra-high-definition_image_dehazing_via_multi-guided_bilateral_learning.pdf","parentItem":"K3LC4X62","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/zheng_et_al_2021_ultra-high-definition_image_dehazing_via_multi-guided_bilateral_learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:44:57Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:44:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/U4XK69TX","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2021\\zheng_et_al_2021_ultra-high-definition_image_dehazing_via_multi-guided_bilateral_learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1623/zheng_et_al_2021_ultra-high-definition_image_dehazing_via_multi-guided_bilateral_learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350060684,"version":0},"$loki":933},{"itemID":1068,"item":{"key":"MQEARZ4K","version":5504,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Uncertainty measure in evidence theory","abstractNote":"As an extension of probability theory, evidence theory is able to better handle unknown and imprecise information. Owing to its advantages, evidence theory has more ﬂexibility and eﬀectiveness for modeling and processing uncertain information. Uncertainty measure plays an essential role both in evidence theory and probability theory. In probability theory, Shannon entropy provides a novel perspective for measuring uncertainty. Various entropies exist for measuring the uncertainty of basic probability assignment (BPA) in evidence theory. However, from the standpoint of the requirements of uncertainty measurement and physics, these entropies are controversial. Therefore, the process for measuring BPA uncertainty currently remains an open issue in the literature. Firstly, this paper reviews the measures of uncertainty in evidence theory followed by an analysis of some related controversies. Secondly, we discuss the development of Deng entropy as an eﬀective way to measure uncertainty, including introducing its deﬁnition, analyzing its properties, and comparing it to other measures. We also examine the concept of maximum Deng entropy, the pseudo-Pascal triangle of maximum Deng entropy, generalized belief entropy, and measures of divergence. In addition, we conduct an analysis of the application of Deng entropy and further examine the challenges for future studies on uncertainty measurement in evidence theory. Finally, a conclusion is provided to summarize this study.","date":"11/2020","language":"en","archive":"0","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-020-3006-9","accessDate":"2023-03-24T13:58:01Z","extra":"Citation Key: deng2020uncertainty","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"63","pages":"210201","publicationTitle":"Science China Information Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s11432-020-3006-9","issue":"11","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Sci.

The proposed exponential negation is an entropy increase operation, and all the probability distributions will converge to the uniform distribution after multiple negation iterations. The convergence speed of the proposed negation is also faster than the existed negation.

However, previous studies are mostly focused on training models with synthetic hazy images, which incurs performance drop when the models are used for real-world hazy images. We propose a Principled Synthetic-to-real Dehazing (PSD) framework to improve the generalization performance of dehazing. Starting from a dehazing model backbone that is pre-trained on synthetic data, PSD exploits real hazy images to ﬁne-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion. For the ﬁne-tuning, we leverage several well-grounded physical priors and combine them into a prior loss committee. PSD allows for most of the existing dehazing models as its backbone, and the combination of multiple physical priors boosts dehazing signiﬁcantly. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PSD framework establishes the new stateof-the-art performance for real-world dehazing, in terms of visual quality assessed by no-reference quality metrics as well as subjective evaluation and downstream task performance indicator.","date":"6/2021","language":"en","shortTitle":"PSD","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578422/","accessDate":"2023-03-30T08:04:17Z","extra":"Citation Key: chen2021psd","place":"Nashville, TN, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-66544-509-2","pages":"7176-7185","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00710","creators":[{"firstName":"Zeyuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yangchao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:17Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2FJSC4LB","itemID":1336,"attachments":[{"key":"RCCUKBDU","version":6134,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chen_et_al_2021_psd.pdf","parentItem":"2FJSC4LB","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/chen_et_al_2021_psd.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:45:23Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:45:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/RCCUKBDU","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2021\\chen_et_al_2021_psd.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1678/chen_et_al_2021_psd.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078153,"version":0},"$loki":949},{"itemID":1008,"item":{"key":"499P5SU6","version":5503,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Rank-One Prior: Toward Real-Time Scene Recovery","abstractNote":"Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task for several practical applications, e.g., video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. To improve visual quality under different weather/imaging conditions, we propose a real-time light correction method to recover the degraded scenes in the cases of sandstorms, underwater, and haze. The heart of our work is that we propose an intensity projection strategy to estimate the transmission. This strategy is motivated by a straightforward rank-one transmission prior. The complexity of transmission estimation is O(N ) where N is the size of the single image. Then we can recover the scene in real-time. Comprehensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that our method outperforms competitively several state-of-the-art imaging methods in terms of efﬁciency and robustness.","date":"2021-04-06","language":"en","shortTitle":"Rank-One Prior","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17126","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:29:53Z","extra":"arXiv:2103.17126 [cs]\nCitation Key: liu2021rankone","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2103.17126","citationKey":"liu2021RankOne","creators":[{"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryan Wen","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianing","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tieyong","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"开源"},{"tag":"real-time correction"},{"tag":"scene recovery"},{"tag":"visual quality enhancement"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:29:53Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:11:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/499P5SU6","itemID":1008,"attachments":[{"key":"IUGVFGJV","version":6131,"itemType":"attachment","title":"liu_et_al_2021_rank-one_prior.pdf","parentItem":"499P5SU6","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/liu_et_al_2021_rank-one_prior.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_IUGVFGJV/1\">1 .

A crucial step in dehazing is the recovery of the global air-light vector. Traditional methods usually interpret the RGB value of the brightest region in haze images as the air-light. In this letter, a new prior called ‘color constancy prior’ has been proposed to improve the robustness of air-light estimation when varicolored illumination exists. The prior utilizes the statistical observation that distant scenery objects become the most haze-opaque due to the pixel escalation towards the higher intensity side. The comparative evaluation on a variety of haze images manifests that the proposed prior perform better than existing air-light recovery methods and can be used for subsequent dehazing applications.","date":"2020","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"工程：电子与电气3区","callNumber":"3.2012","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201388/","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:28:46Z","rights":"3.7347","extra":"Citation Key: gautam2020improved","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"27","pages":"1695-1699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LSP.2020.3025462","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Ieee Signal Proc Let","ISSN":"1070-9908, 1558-2361","creators":[{"firstName":"Sidharth","lastName":"Gautam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tapan Kumar","lastName":"Gandhi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B.K.","lastName":"Panigrahi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"雾线估计"},{"tag":"air-light vector"},{"tag":"color constancy prior"},{"tag":"dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:28:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4SA8788T","itemID":1316,"attachments":[{"key":"AZ3X3BRD","version":6138,"itemType":"attachment","title":"gautam_et_al_2020_an_improved_air-light_estimation_scheme_for_single_haze_images_using_color.pdf","parentItem":"4SA8788T","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2020/gautam_et_al_2020_an_improved_air-light_estimation_scheme_for_single_haze_images_using_color.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:46:00Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:46:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AZ3X3BRD","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2020\\gautam_et_al_2020_an_improved_air-light_estimation_scheme_for_single_haze_images_using_color.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1670/gautam_et_al_2020_an_improved_air-light_estimation_scheme_for_single_haze_images_using_color.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"B2WWRJJK","version":4831,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"4SA8788T","note":"<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/sidharthscorpio/color-constancy-prior\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://github.com/sidharthscorpio/color-constancy-prior</a></p>\n<p>对应的开源代码</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:29:36Z","dateModified":"2023-03-29T05:29:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/B2WWRJJK"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078164,"version":0},"$loki":951},{"itemID":1312,"item":{"key":"5ARQCPFZ","version":5508,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sandstorm image","abstractNote":"In this paper, a novel image enhancing approach focuses on single sandstorm image is proposed. The degraded image has some problems, such as color distortion, low-visibility, fuzz and non-uniform luminance, due to the light is absorbed and scattered by particles in sandstorm. The proposed approach based on fusion principles aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations. First, the degraded image is color corrected by adopting a statistical strategy. Then two inputs, which represent different brightness, are derived only from the color corrected image by applying Gamma correction. Three weighted maps (sharpness, chromaticity and prominence), which contain important features to increase the quality of the degraded image, are computed from the derived inputs. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by fusing the inputs with the weight maps. The proposed method is the ﬁrst to adopt a fusion-based method for enhancing single sandstorm image. Experimental results show that enhanced results can be improved by color correction, well enhanced details and local contrast while promoted global brightness, increasing the visibility, naturalness preservation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is mostly calculated by per-pixel operation, which is appropriate for real-time applications.","date":"9/2014","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6958791/","accessDate":"2023-03-28T09:27:03Z","extra":"Citation Key: fu2014fusionbased","place":"Jakarta, Indonesia","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-4799-5896-2","pages":"1-5","proceedingsTitle":"2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","conferenceName":"2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","DOI":"10.1109/MMSP.2014.6958791","creators":[{"firstName":"Xueyang","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Delu","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiao-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinghao","lastName":"Ding","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"fusion-based method"},{"tag":"image enhancement"},{"tag":"sandstorm"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T09:27:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5ARQCPFZ","itemID":1312,"attachments":[{"key":"6T42FSFH","version":6166,"itemType":"attachment","title":"fu_et_al_2014_a_fusion-based_enhancing_approach_for_single_sandstorm_image.pdf","parentItem":"5ARQCPFZ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2014/fu_et_al_2014_a_fusion-based_enhancing_approach_for_single_sandstorm_image.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:47:43Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:47:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6T42FSFH","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2014\\fu_et_al_2014_a_fusion-based_enhancing_approach_for_single_sandstorm_image.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1610/fu_et_al_2014_a_fusion-based_enhancing_approach_for_single_sandstorm_image.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078166,"version":0},"$loki":952},{"itemID":1314,"item":{"key":"5EX8Q5NI","version":5508,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fast color balance and multi-path fusion for sandstorm image enhancement","abstractNote":"Outdoor images captured during sandstorm weather condition frequently yield color cast and poor visibility, which causes some applications to fail in computer vision, such as video surveillance and object recognition systems. In this paper, a fast color balance method followed by an effective fusion model is proposed to enhance the sandstorm-degraded images. Firstly, color channel compensation and piece-wise afﬁne transform balance the aberrant pixels obtained by camera and remove color cast. Then, multi-path fusion comprising of underexposure and contrast-enhanced inputs is used for visibility enhancement, where saturation and Laplacian contrast are measured as weight maps and constructed for Gaussian pyramids. In order to reduce block effects and artifacts of the reconstructed image, we introduce the multi-scale strategy for each path. Experimental results of both synthetic and real-world sandstorm images demonstrate that the proposed color balance method features high computational efﬁciency and performs much better than comparative methods in terms of image quality. In addition, our fusion-based method also outperforms existing enhancement algorithms of sandstorm image via qualitative and quantitative evaluations.","date":"04/2021","language":"en","archive":"Q4","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"工程：电子与电气4区  成像科学与照相技术4区","callNumber":"1.5828","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-020-01786-1","accessDate":"2023-03-28T15:05:56Z","rights":"1.5300","extra":"Citation Key: wang2021fast","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"637-644","publicationTitle":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","DOI":"10.1007/s11760-020-01786-1","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Signal Image Video P","ISSN":"1863-1703, 1863-1711","creators":[{"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Wei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zitong","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chongyi","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"color balance"},{"tag":"fusion-based method"},{"tag":"sandstorm images"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T15:05:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5EX8Q5NI","itemID":1314,"attachments":[{"key":"5Y57NEVP","version":6134,"itemType":"attachment","title":"wang_et_al_2021_fast_color_balance_and_multi-path_fusion_for_sandstorm_image_enhancement.pdf","parentItem":"5EX8Q5NI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/wang_et_al_2021_fast_color_balance_and_multi-path_fusion_for_sandstorm_image_enhancement.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/1\">Abstract</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/2\">2 Color balance and multi-path fusion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/2\">2.1 Fast color balance</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/3\">2.2 Multi-path fusion</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/5\">3 Experiments and analysis</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/5\">3.1 Evaluation of fast color balance</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/6\">3.2 Evaluation of multi-path fusion</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/6\">4 Conclusion and future work</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/6\">Acknowledgements</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_5Y57NEVP/7\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:45:06Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:45:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5Y57NEVP","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2021\\wang_et_al_2021_fast_color_balance_and_multi-path_fusion_for_sandstorm_image_enhancement.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1683/wang_et_al_2021_fast_color_balance_and_multi-path_fusion_for_sandstorm_image_enhancement.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078169,"version":0},"$loki":953},{"itemID":1011,"item":{"key":"5YLKH4EX","version":5503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Single image dehazing based on bright channel prior model and saliency analysis strategy","abstractNote":"Haze is a common atmospheric phenomenon that causes poor visibility in outdoor images, which greatly limits image application in later stages. Therefore, haze removal has become the ﬁrst and most indispensable step when dealing with degraded images. In this paper, we propose a novel bright channel prior (BCP) model and a saliency analysis strategy for haze removal. First, we obtain a more robust and accurate atmospheric light by a superpixelbased dark channel method. Second, we utilize the dark channel prior (DCP) to handle dark regions in hazy images. However, the DCP often mistakes white regions for opaque haze and thus causes serious colour distortion and halo effects. To solve this problem, a new BCP is proposed to accurately estimate the transmission of bright regions in hazy images. Third, we fuse the DCP and BCP using a multiscale fusion strategy with Laplacian pyramid representation to gain the correct transmission information for both bright and dark regions. Finally, a novel saliency analysis strategy for transmission reﬁnement is proposed, so that the texture details can remain present to the greatest extent in the restored images. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed method performs well in restoring images containing bright objects.","date":"04/2021","language":"en","archive":"Q3/Q4","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"1.7729","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ipr2.12082","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:30:03Z","rights":"1.9592","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2021single","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"1023-1031","publicationTitle":"IET Image Processing","DOI":"10.1049/ipr2.12082","issue":"5","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Iet Image Process","ISSN":"1751-9659, 1751-9667","creators":[{"firstName":"Libao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaohan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"bright channel prior"},{"tag":"haze removal"},{"tag":"image restoration"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:30:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5YLKH4EX","itemID":1011,"attachments":[{"key":"3R3VV7XF","version":6196,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhang_et_al_2021_single_image_dehazing_based_on_bright_channel_prior_model_and_saliency_analysis.pdf","parentItem":"5YLKH4EX","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/zhang_et_al_2021_single_image_dehazing_based_on_bright_channel_prior_model_and_saliency_analysis.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

The dark channel prior is a kind of statistics of outdoor haze-free images. It is based on a key observation—most local patches in outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior.

However, the RO components of a corrupted image could be decimated by the procedure of image denoising. We suggest that the RO property should be utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks, extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information. Experimental results on four tasks, i.e., noise-free image super-resolution (SR), realistic image SR, gray-scale image denoising, and color image denoising, show that the method is effective and efficient for image restoration, and it delivers superior performance for realistic image SR and color image denoising.","date":"2022-6-1","language":"en","shortTitle":"Rank-One Network","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能1区  工程：电子与电气1区","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12610","accessDate":"2023-03-30T08:04:34Z","extra":"arXiv:2011.12610 [cs, eess]\nCitation Key: gao2022rankone","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"44","pages":"3224-3238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3046476","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

Because of the ﬂexibility and eﬀectiveness in modeling and processing the uncertain information regardless of prior probabilities, Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is widely applied in a variety of ﬁelds of information fusion. However, counter-intuitive results may come out when fusing the highly conﬂicting evidences. In order to deal with this problem, a novel method for multi-sensor data fusion based on a new belief divergence measure of evidences and the belief entropy was proposed. First, a new Belief Jensen–Shannon divergence is devised to measure the discrepancy and conﬂict degree between the evidences; then, the credibility degree can be obtained to represent the reliability of the evidences. Next, considering the uncertainties of the evidences, the information volume of the evidences are measured by making use of the belief entropy to indicate the relative importance of the evidences. Afterwards, the credibility degree of each evidence is modiﬁed by taking advantage of the quantitative information volume which will be utilized to obtain an appropriate weight in terms of each evidence. Ultimately, the ﬁnal weights of the evidences are applied to adjust the bodies of the evidences before using the Dempster’s combination rule. A numerical example is illustrated that the proposed method is feasible and effective in handling the conﬂicting evidences, where the belief value of target increases to 99.05%. Furthermore, an application in fault diagnosis is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

When handling the high conflict information, traditional Dempster combination rule can produce counterintuitive results. Hence, the reasonable conflict measure is essential in information fusion. Inspired by this view, the paper propose the new method to measure conflict between bodies of evidence. Firstly, we define a new information volume of mass function for the perspective of information discord and non-specificity. Second, we propose a generalized divergence based on information volume of mass function, denoted as Jensen–Shannon divergence of information volume (𝐼𝐽 𝑆). 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 can effectively measure the conflict between bodies of evidence. 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 reflects the conflict between bodies of evidence in terms of the differences between the support of propositions and the elements. That is, compared to the current approach, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 not only fully considers the differences between the support degree of propositions, but also the differences of elements in propositions from the perspective of information non-specificity. When the mass function degenerates to a probabilistic distribution, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 also degenerates to the classical Jensen–Shannon divergence. Meanwhile, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 also satisfies the axioms of distance measure, such as non-negativity, symmetry and etc. Further, we proved these axioms based on mathematical derivation, and some numerical examples are applied to explain axioms and advantages. Based on the proposed divergence measure, we propose a multi-source information fusion method in the real world, and several data sets can be used to show that the proposed fusion method is superior to current method under the framework of evidence theory.","date":"02/2022","language":"en","archive":"Q1","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197621004164","accessDate":"2023-03-19T04:56:33Z","rights":"6.6936","extra":"Citation Key: gao2022generalized","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"108","pages":"104584","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104584","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"09521976","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaozhuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-19T04:56:33Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BYZPBSBY","itemID":990,"attachments":[{"key":"6NIW94F7","version":6130,"itemType":"attachment","title":"gao_et_al_2022_a_generalized_divergence_of_information_volume_and_its_applications.pdf","parentItem":"BYZPBSBY","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2022/gao_et_al_2022_a_generalized_divergence_of_information_volume_and_its_applications.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/1\">Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/2\">Preliminaries</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/2\">Dempster–Shafer Evidence theory</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/3\">Information volume of the mass function</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/3\">A generalized divergence for information volume of mass function</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/3\">A new information volume of the mass function</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/3\">A generalized divergence based on information volume of mass function</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/5\">Numerical examples</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/5\">Method and applications</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/5\">A new multi-source information fusion method</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/9\">Application of iris recognition</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/9\">Application of fault diagnosis</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/11\">Conclusion</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/11\">CRediT authorship contribution statement</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/11\">Declaration of competing interest</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/11\">Acknowledgements</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6NIW94F7/11\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:44:40Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:44:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6NIW94F7","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2022\\gao_et_al_2022_a_generalized_divergence_of_information_volume_and_its_applications.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1629/gao_et_al_2022_a_generalized_divergence_of_information_volume_and_its_applications.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078211,"version":0},"$loki":962},{"itemID":27,"item":{"key":"E7PZCYT7","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A new distance between two bodies of evidence","abstractNote":"We present a measure of performance (MOP) for identi®cation algorithms based on the evidential theory of Dempster±Shafer.

Currently, the existed uncertainty measures in the DST framework are limited to the closed world where the frame of discernment (FOD) is assumed to be complete. To address this issue, this paper focuses on extending a belief entropy to the open world by considering the uncertain information represented as the FOD and the nonzero mass function of the empty set simultaneously. An extension to Deng’s entropy in the open world assumption (EDEOW) is proposed as a generalization of the Deng’s entropy and it can be degenerated to the Deng entropy in the closed world wherever necessary. In order to test the reasonability and effectiveness of the extended belief entropy, an EDEOW-based information fusion approach is proposed and applied to sensor data fusion under uncertainty circumstance. The experimental results verify the usefulness and applicability of the extended measure as well as the modified sensor data fusion method. In addition, a few open issues still exist in the current work: the necessary properties for a belief entropy in the open world assumption, whether there exists a belief entropy that satisfies all the existed properties, and what is the most proper fusion frame for sensor data fusion under uncertainty.","date":"2018/6","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"分析化学3区  工程：电子与电气3区  仪器仪表3区","callNumber":"3.8470","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/6/1902","accessDate":"2023-03-24T14:00:55Z","rights":"4.0501","extra":"Number: 6\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute\nCitation Key: tang2018extension","seriesTitle":"自然科学A","volume":"18","pages":"1902","publicationTitle":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s18061902","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Sensors-basel","ISSN":"1424-8220","creators":[{"firstName":"Yongchuan","lastName":"Tang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix T.

Recently there has been great success in single image dehazing, i.e., improving the visibility and restoring the colors from a single image. A crucial step in these methods is the calculation of the air-light color, the color of an area of the image with no objects in line-of-sight. We propose a new method for calculating the air-light. The method relies on the haze-lines prior that was recently introduced. This prior is based on the observation that the pixel values of a hazy image can be modeled as lines in RGB space that intersect at the air-light. We use Hough transform in RGB space to vote for the location of the air-light. We evaluate the proposed method on an existing dataset of real world images, as well as some synthetic and other real images. Our method performs on-par with current state-of-the-art techniques and is more computationally efﬁcient.","date":"5/2017","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7951489/","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:29:36Z","extra":"Citation Key: berman2017airlight","place":"Stanford, CA, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-5090-5745-0","pages":"1-9","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","DOI":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2017.7951489","creators":[{"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Berman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Treibitz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shai","lastName":"Avidan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"air-light calculation"},{"tag":"haze-lines prior"},{"tag":"single image dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:29:36Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/H93PDAZU","itemID":1006,"attachments":[{"key":"A9IE6SIM","version":6153,"itemType":"attachment","title":"berman_et_al_2017_air-light_estimation_using_haze-lines.pdf","parentItem":"H93PDAZU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2017/berman_et_al_2017_air-light_estimation_using_haze-lines.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:46:56Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:46:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/A9IE6SIM","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2017\\berman_et_al_2017_air-light_estimation_using_haze-lines.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1653/berman_et_al_2017_air-light_estimation_using_haze-lines.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078297,"version":0},"$loki":970},{"itemID":1007,"item":{"key":"J5JWVLMX","version":5503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Fast Single Image Haze Removal Algorithm Using Color Attenuation Prior","abstractNote":"Single image haze removal has been a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful color attenuation prior for haze removal from a single input hazy image. By creating a linear model for modeling the scene depth of the hazy image under this novel prior and learning the parameters of the model with a supervised learning method, the depth information can be well recovered. With the depth map of the hazy image, we can easily estimate the transmission and restore the scene radiance via the atmospheric scattering model, and thus effectively remove the haze from a single image.

It is concerned with the identiﬁcation of the levels of preference that decision makers have towards certain decision alternatives (DAs), through preference judgements made over a number of different criteria. The working result from a DS/AHP analysis is the body of evidence (BOE), which includes a series of mass values that represent the exact beliefs in the best DA(s) existing within certain subsets of DAs. This paper considers the role of DS/AHP as an aid to group decision-making, through the utilisation of a distance measure (between BOEs). Here, the distance measure enables the identiﬁcation of the members of the decision-making group who are in most agreement, with respect to the judgements they have individually made. The utilisation of a single linkage dendrite approach to clustering elucidates an appropriate order to the aggregation of the judgements of the group members. This develops the DS/AHP method as a tool to identify inter-group alliances, as well as introduce a ‘majority rule’ approach to decision-making through consensus building.","date":"1/2006","language":"en","archive":"Q2/Q3","callNumber":"2.9279","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10726-005-1159-9","accessDate":"2023-03-15T07:12:35Z","rights":"2.5271","extra":"Citation Key: beynon2006role","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"21-42","publicationTitle":"Group Decision and Negotiation","DOI":"10.1007/s10726-005-1159-9","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Group Decis Negot","ISSN":"0926-2644, 1572-9907","creators":[{"firstName":"Malcolm J.","lastName":"Beynon","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:12:35Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LKPE23CI","itemID":960,"attachments":[{"key":"5JJHI5GK","version":6177,"itemType":"attachment","title":"beynon_2006_the_role_of_the_ds-ahp_in_identifying_inter-group_alliances_and_majority_rule.pdf","parentItem":"LKPE23CI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2006/beynon_2006_the_role_of_the_ds-ahp_in_identifying_inter-group_alliances_and_majority_rule.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:48:58Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:48:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5JJHI5GK","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2006\\beynon_2006_the_role_of_the_ds-ahp_in_identifying_inter-group_alliances_and_majority_rule.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1588/beynon_2006_the_role_of_the_ds-ahp_in_identifying_inter-group_alliances_and_majority_rule.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078324,"version":0},"$loki":975},{"itemID":33,"item":{"key":"MKBBMAK2","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Pseudo-Pascal Triangle of Maximum Deng Entropy","abstractNote":"Pascal triangle (known as Yang Hui Triangle in Chinese) is an important model in mathematics while the entropy has been heavily studied in physics or as uncertainty measure in information science. How to construct the the connection between Pascal triangle and uncertainty measure is an interesting topic. One of the most used entropy, Tasllis entropy, has been modelled with Pascal triangle. But the relationship of the other entropy functions with Pascal triangle is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory takes the advantage to deal with uncertainty than probability theory since the probability distribution is generalized as basic probability assignment, which is more eﬃcient to model and handle uncertain information. Given a basic probability assignment, its corresponding uncertainty measure can be determined by Deng entropy, which is the generalization of Shannon entropy. In this paper, a Pseudo-Pascal triangle based the maximum Deng entropy is constructed. Similar to the Pascal triangle modelling of Tasllis entropy, this work provides the a possible way of Deng entropy in physics and information theory.","date":"2020-02-03","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/1006","accessDate":"2022-09-18T14:15:03Z","extra":"Citation Key: gao2020pseudopascal","volume":"15","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2020.1.3735","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

Therefore, the decision about whether to use a Markov or a quantum system depends on which of these laws are empirically obeyed in an application. This article derives two general methods for testing these theories that are parameter free, and presents a new experimental test. The article concludes with a review of experimental findings from cognitive psychology that evaluate these two properties.","date":"10/2009","language":"en","archive":"Q4","archiveLocation":"医学3区","libraryCatalog":"数学跨学科应用3区","callNumber":"1.3869","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022249609000352","accessDate":"2023-03-24T14:26:29Z","rights":"3.0172","extra":"Citation Key: busemeyer2009empirical","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"53","pages":"423-433","publicationTitle":"Journal of Mathematical Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmp.2009.03.002","issue":"5","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"J Math Psychol","ISSN":"00222496","creators":[{"firstName":"Jerome R.","lastName":"Busemeyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ariane","lastName":"Lambert-Mogiliansky","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["55EH4EMM","BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/8FPMLHMI"]},"dateAdded":"2022-10-18T03:20:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-03T10:58:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/S3DQSASI","itemID":1208,"attachments":[{"key":"VIABZAZW","version":6176,"itemType":"attachment","title":"busemeyer_et_al_2009_empirical_comparison_of_markov_and_quantum_models_of_decision_making.pdf","parentItem":"S3DQSASI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2009/busemeyer_et_al_2009_empirical_comparison_of_markov_and_quantum_models_of_decision_making.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:48:38Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:48:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/VIABZAZW","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2009\\busemeyer_et_al_2009_empirical_comparison_of_markov_and_quantum_models_of_decision_making.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1594/busemeyer_et_al_2009_empirical_comparison_of_markov_and_quantum_models_of_decision_making.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078346,"version":0},"$loki":979},{"itemID":26,"item":{"key":"SJM238E9","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Combining belief functions when evidence conflicts","abstractNote":"The use of belief functions to represent and to manipulate uncertainty in expert systems has been advocated by some practitioners and researchers.

Low-contrast can result from foggy weather conditions during image acquisition. Dehazing is a process of removal of haze from the photography of a hazy scene. Single-image dehazing based on dark channel priors are well-known techniques in this field. However, the performance of such techniques is limited to priors or constraints. Moreover, this type of method fails when images have sky-region. So, a method is proposed, which can restore the visibility of hazy images. First, a hazy image is divided into blocks of size 32 × 32, then the score of each block is calculated to select a block having the highest score. Atmospheric light is calculated from the selected block. A new color channel is considered to remove atmospheric scattering, obtained channel value and atmospheric light are then used to calculate the transmission map in the second step. Third, radiance is computed using a transmission map and atmospheric light. The illumination scaling factor is adopted to enhance the quality of a dehazed image in the final step. Experiments are performed on six datasets namely, I-HAZE, O-HAZE, BSDS500, FRIDA, RESIDE dataset and natural images from Google. The proposed method is compared against 11 state-of-the-art methods. The performance is analyzed using fourteen quantitative evaluation metrics. All the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in most of the cases.","date":"01/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"2.8869","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1047320320302212","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:29:58Z","rights":"2.7112","extra":"Citation Key: sahu2021single","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"74","pages":"103008","publicationTitle":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2020.103008","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"J Vis Commun Image R","ISSN":"10473203","creators":[{"firstName":"Geet","lastName":"Sahu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayan","lastName":"Seal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Krejcar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Yazidi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"haze removal"},{"tag":"image enhancement"},{"tag":"single-image dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:29:58Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UJV8ISVE","itemID":1010,"attachments":[{"key":"ZSGBHA3N","version":6130,"itemType":"attachment","title":"sahu_et_al_2021_single_image_dehazing_using_a_new_color_channel.pdf","parentItem":"UJV8ISVE","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/sahu_et_al_2021_single_image_dehazing_using_a_new_color_channel.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Unlike previous researches on the atmospheric light estimation, this study reveals a vector orthogonality in the classical atmospheric color degradation model for the first time. It is demonstrated that atmospheric light vector is orthogonal to the normal vectors of color degradation plane. Furthermore, a novel estimation method for direction and magnitude of atmospheric light vector is proposed based on the vector orthogonality. The proposed method can accurately estimate the atmospheric light and improve the quality of image dehazing with a short constant processing time even if the image resolution is increasing.

These studies have mainly focused on investigating which alternative would be appropriate for which conﬂicting situation, under the assumption that a conﬂict is identiﬁed. The issue of detection (or identiﬁcation) of conﬂict among evidence has been ignored. In this paper, we formally deﬁne when two basic belief assignments are in conﬂict. This deﬁnition deploys quantitative measures of both the mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset before normalization and the distance between betting commitments of beliefs. We argue that only when both measures are high, it is safe to say the evidence is in conﬂict. This deﬁnition can be served as a prerequisite for selecting appropriate combination rules.","date":"08/2006","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0004370206000658","accessDate":"2022-09-18T14:14:46Z","extra":"Citation Key: liu2006analyzing","volume":"170","pages":"909-924","publicationTitle":"Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.artint.2006.05.002","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"00043702","creators":[{"firstName":"Weiru","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2KBDSHEN","http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5RTFC2GC","http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/W3WZCU3H"]},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:14:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Y8CI63LU","itemID":30,"attachments":[{"key":"JWKB875R","version":5,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Liu2006.md","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Liu2006.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:24:17Z","dateModified":"2022-09-18T14:24:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JWKB875R","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Liu2006.md","defaultPath":"files/38/@Liu2006.md"},{"key":"JQZFL9VN","version":3773,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:08:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:21:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JQZFL9VN","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/286/2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf"},{"key":"GFKU2WRX","version":3773,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:08:57Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:21:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GFKU2WRX","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf","defaultPath":"files/287/2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf"},{"key":"Q5RHJPV4","version":6177,"itemType":"attachment","title":"liu_2006_analyzing_the_degree_of_conflict_among_belief_functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2006/liu_2006_analyzing_the_degree_of_conflict_among_belief_functions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/PU27VB9Q"]},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:48:52Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:48:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Q5RHJPV4","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2006\\liu_2006_analyzing_the_degree_of_conflict_among_belief_functions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1590/liu_2006_analyzing_the_degree_of_conflict_among_belief_functions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350078406,"version":0},"$loki":987},{"itemID":1517,"item":{"key":"6FJZVKHH","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved few-shot learning method for transformer fault diagnosis based on approximation space and belief functions","abstractNote":"Incomplete and uncertain information is frequently observed in the data analysis processes, which has become one of main challenges for the development of fault diagnosis techniques of transformers. To address few fault cases and deficient monitoring information in diagnostic tasks, this paper provides an improved few-shot learning method based on approximation space and belief functions to accomplish fault diagnosis of transformers. The decision-making table, as an efficient structure to map the weakly correlated attributes, is extracted from transformer cases and maintenance experience. Then the approximation space is used to describe attribute correlations between diagnostic rules and the diagnostic task. We employ the 0.5-approximation set strategy to obtain the diagnostic results when the information is sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a modified basic probability assignment (BPA) calculation method to build belief functions for diagnosis when information is scanty. The modified method is verified capable of improving the decision-making reliability. The overall recognition accuracy of fault diagnosis by our improved few-shot learning algorithm is over 87% which is higher than other four peer methods. This method also shows a potential for good expandability when new diagnostic rules of transformers are discovered.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420308587","extra":"Citation Key: xu2021improved","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"167","pages":"114105","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114105","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yaoyu","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yijing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dexing","lastName":"Zhong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guanjun","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Evidence theory"},{"tag":"Belief functions"},{"tag":"Approximation space"},{"tag":"Few-shot learning"},{"tag":"Rough set"},{"tag":"Transformer fault diagnosis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:16:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6FJZVKHH","itemID":1517,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350186933,"version":0},"$loki":992},{"itemID":949,"item":{"key":"6ML5334B","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:11:34Z","dateModified":"2023-03-15T07:11:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6ML5334B","itemID":949,"localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\6ML5334B\\9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","defaultPath":"files/949/9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350186937,"version":0},"$loki":993},{"itemID":951,"item":{"key":"6UNPK3GR","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"9-2 广义证据理论及应用（2）：广义基本概率指派.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"9-2 广义证据理论及应用（2）：广义基本概率指派.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:11:37Z","dateModified":"2023-03-15T07:11:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6UNPK3GR","itemID":951,"localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\6UNPK3GR\\9-2 广义证据理论及应用（2）：广义基本概率指派.pdf","defaultPath":"files/951/9-2 广义证据理论及应用（2）：广义基本概率指派.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350186939,"version":0},"$loki":994},{"itemID":349,"item":{"key":"7MCUFCJK","version":5495,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing properties of Deng entropy in the theory of evidence","abstractNote":"The theory of Evidence, or Shafer-Dempster theory (DST), has been widely used in applications. The DST is based on the concept of a basic probability assignment. An important part of this theory is the quantification of the information-based-uncertainty that this function represents. A recent measure of uncertainty (or information) in this theory, called the Deng entropy, has appeared as an interesting alternative to the measures presented so far. This measure quantifies the both types of uncertainty found in DST, then it is considered as a total uncertainty measure (TU). It is shown that this measure does not verify some of the essential properties for a TU in DST such as monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity. Also, the definition of this new measure produces other debatable situations. These shortcomings call in question the utility of this measure in applications.","date":"2017-02-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077916303836","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:12:11Z","extra":"Citation Key: abellan2017analyzing","volume":"95","pages":"195-199","publicationTitle":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"10.1016/j.chaos.2016.12.024","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","ISSN":"0960-0779","creators":[{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Deng entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Discord","type":1},{"tag":"Imprecise probabilities","type":1},{"tag":"Measures of uncertainty","type":1},{"tag":"Non-specificity","type":1},{"tag":"Theory of evidence","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:12:11Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7MCUFCJK","itemID":349,"attachments":[{"key":"HKVHA646","version":1207,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Abellan2017.md","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Abellan2017.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T03:34:02Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T03:34:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/HKVHA646","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Abellan2017.md","defaultPath":"files/444/@Abellan2017.md"},{"key":"3FWEE25C","version":6046,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Abellan2017.md","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Abellan2017.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:46:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:46:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3FWEE25C","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\3FWEE25C\\@Abellan2017.md","defaultPath":"files/1202/@Abellan2017.md"},{"key":"RG8SXGVC","version":6156,"itemType":"attachment","title":"abellán_2017_analyzing_properties_of_deng_entropy_in_the_theory_of_evidence.pdf","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2017/abellán_2017_analyzing_properties_of_deng_entropy_in_the_theory_of_evidence.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

But in real life, the results of things usually change over time, and the prediction of the information volume contained in the future is still an open question. Deng entropy proposed by Deng in recent years is widely applied on measuring the uncertainty, but its physical explanation is controversial. In this paper, we give Deng entropy a new explanation based on the fractal idea, and proposed its generalization called time fractal-based (TFB) entropy. The TFB entropy is recognized as predicting the uncertainty over a period of time by splitting times, and its maximum value, called higher order information volume of mass function (HOIVMF), can express more uncertain information than all of existing methods.","date":"2020-12-14","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07507","accessDate":"2022-11-04T07:19:03Z","extra":"arXiv:2012.07507 [cs, math]\nCitation Key: zhou2020higher","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2012.07507","citationKey":"Zhou2020","creators":[{"firstName":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Information Theory","type":1},{"tag":"Mathematics - Probability","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NE7GJ2G4"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T07:19:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/DUQ9S5DV","itemID":229,"attachments":[{"key":"99L4V8JQ","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhou2020.md","parentItem":"DUQ9S5DV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhou2020.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:19:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-04T08:19:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/99L4V8JQ","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\99L4V8JQ\\@Zhou2020.md","defaultPath":"files/1080/@Zhou2020.md"},{"key":"J98P8GS7","version":6198,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhou_deng_2020_higher_order_information_volume_of_mass_function.pdf","parentItem":"DUQ9S5DV","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2020/zhou_deng_2020_higher_order_information_volume_of_mass_function.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Recently, the relations between Pascal’s triangle and maximum Deng entropy are studied and presented. A straightforward idea comes: if we design a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, what would the generated number sequence and the corresponding ratio be like? Hence, this paper proposes a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, named as the maximum Deng entropy triangle (MDET). Besides, the number sequences based on MDET are investigated. Next, the general term for the MDET sequence is presented and the ratio in MDET sequence is analyzed.

In this paper we propose a set of intuitively desirable axioms for a measure of total uncertainty (TU) associated with a basic assignment m(A), and then derive an expression for a (unique) function that satisfies these requirements. Several theorems are proved about the new measure. Our measure is additive, and unlike other TU measures, has a unique maximum. The new measure reduces to Shannon's probabilistic entropy when the basic probability assignment focuses only on singletons. On the other hand, complete ignorance—basic assignment focusing only on the entire set, as a whole—reduces it to Hartley's measure of information. We show that the computational complexity of the new measure is O(N), whereas previous measures of TU are O(N2). Finally, we compare the new measure to its predecessors by extending the numerical example of Part I so that it includes values of the new measure.","date":"1993-01-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能4区","callNumber":"4.4522","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X05800039","accessDate":"2023-03-26T03:18:43Z","rights":"3.5438","extra":"Citation Key: pal1993uncertainty","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"8","pages":"1-16","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","DOI":"10.1016/S0888-613X(05)80003-9","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Approx Reason","ISSN":"0888-613X","creators":[{"firstName":"Nikhil R.","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James C.","lastName":"Bezdek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Hemasinha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Conflict","type":1},{"tag":"confusion","type":1},{"tag":"dissonance","type":1},{"tag":"entropy","type":1},{"tag":"evidential reasoning","type":1},{"tag":"specificity","type":1},{"tag":"uncertainty","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-26T03:18:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KGCQ2EF4","itemID":1257,"attachments":[{"key":"EJTKP9UC","version":6178,"itemType":"attachment","title":"pal_et_al_1993_uncertainty_measures_for_evidential_reasoning_ii.pdf","parentItem":"KGCQ2EF4","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:1993/pal_et_al_1993_uncertainty_measures_for_evidential_reasoning_ii.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:49:53Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/EJTKP9UC","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive -

Attenuation under water varies with wavelength, unlike terrestrial images where attenuation is assumed to be spectrally uniform. The attenuation depends both on the water body and the 3D structure of the scene, making color restoration difficult. Unlike existing single underwater image enhancement techniques, our method takes into account multiple spectral profiles of different water types. By estimating just two additional global parameters: the attenuation ratios of the blue-red and blue-green color channels, the problem is reduced to single image dehazing, where all color channels have the same attenuation coefficients. Since the water type is unknown, we evaluate different parameters out of an existing library of water types. Each type leads to a different restored image and the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution. We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying water properties, showing color charts in the scenes. Moreover, to obtain ground truth, the 3D structure of the scene was calculated based on stereo imaging. This dataset enables a quantitative evaluation of restoration algorithms on natural images and shows the advantage of our method.","date":"2019-03-24","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01343","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:32:42Z","extra":"arXiv:1811.01343 [cs]\nversion: 3\nCitation Key: berman2019underwater","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1811.01343","citationKey":"berman2019Underwater","creators":[{"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Berman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Levy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shai","lastName":"Avidan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Treibitz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"开源"},{"tag":"色衰"},{"tag":"color restoration"},{"tag":"spectral profiles"},{"tag":"underwater images"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:32:42Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:11:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QKEY7V6D","itemID":1318,"attachments":[{"key":"Q6RWUP9D","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01343","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:33:08Z","parentItem":"QKEY7V6D","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1811.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:33:08Z","dateModified":"2023-03-29T05:33:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Q6RWUP9D","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\Q6RWUP9D\\1811.html","defaultPath":"files/1321/1811.html"},{"key":"T9UG64IS","version":6197,"itemType":"attachment","title":"berman_et_al_2019_underwater_single_image_color_restoration_using_haze-lines_and_a_new.pdf","parentItem":"QKEY7V6D","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2019/berman_et_al_2019_underwater_single_image_color_restoration_using_haze-lines_and_a_new.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Although some scholars put forward various measurements and entropies of BPA, due to the existence of discord and non-specificity, there is no method can measure BPA reasonably. In order to utilize BPA to practical decision-making, pignistic probability transformation of BPA is a significant method. In the paper, we simulate the pignistic probability transformation (PPT) process based on the fractal idea, which describes PPT process in detail and shows the process of information volume changes during transformation intuitively. Based on transformation process, we propose a new belief entropy called fractal-based belief (FB) entropy. After verification, FB entropy is superior to all existing belief entropies in terms of total uncertainty measurement and physical model consistency.","date":"2022-03-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025521012536","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:17:49Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhou2022fractalbased","volume":"587","pages":"265-282","publicationTitle":"Information Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.ins.2021.12.032","journalAbbreviation":"Information Sciences","ISSN":"0020-0255","creators":[{"firstName":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"Fractal","type":1},{"tag":"Pignistic probability transformation","type":1},{"tag":"Total uncertainty measurement","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:17:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/T4A87YG8","itemID":357,"attachments":[{"key":"UEDTWI56","version":6034,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhou2022.md","parentItem":"T4A87YG8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhou2022.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:45:49Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:45:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UEDTWI56","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\UEDTWI56\\@Zhou2022.md","defaultPath":"files/1078/@Zhou2022.md"},{"key":"A963IUJS","version":6031,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025521012536","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:18:17Z","parentItem":"T4A87YG8","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0020025521012536.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:18:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:18:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/A963IUJS","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\A963IUJS\\S0020025521012536.html","defaultPath":"files/360/S0020025521012536.html"},{"key":"MHP5YFNT","version":6197,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhou_deng_2022_fractal-based_belief_entropy.pdf","parentItem":"T4A87YG8","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2022/zhou_deng_2022_fractal-based_belief_entropy.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

It offers more flexibility and better achievements when compared with similar systems based on IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) technology, especially for fingerprinting-based positioning systems. The literature on these systems is rich and growing; however, not all its possible algorithms have been tested and compared under similar conditions for this emergence technology. This work presents a thorough analysis of the state of the art on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) algorithms used for fingerprinting systems. Based on this study, a novel scheme for fingerprinting methods classification is proposed. Then, a performance comparison between the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) databases is carried out, assessing training time, parameter optimization, computational time, and positioning accuracy. For the sake of completeness, a new database is provided and compared with the others to analyze how the environment can affect the accuracy of each method. The results show that those techniques based on the Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (Wk-NN) algorithm perform better on average for large scale deployments; besides, they do not require any previous training and consume less time to optimize their parameters. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines (SVM) provides the best accuracy with less computational and training time in small environments.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005012","extra":"Citation Key: aranda2022performance","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"202","pages":"117095","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117095","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Fernando J.","lastName":"Aranda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Parralejo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fernando J.","lastName":"Álvarez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José A.","lastName":"Paredes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BLE"},{"tag":"Fingerprinting"},{"tag":"Indoor positioning"},{"tag":"Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)"},{"tag":"Support Vector Machines (SVM)"},{"tag":"Weighted -Nearest Neighbours (W-NN)"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:17:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9EQV4NWJ","itemID":1518,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350233096,"version":0},"$loki":1018},{"itemID":1519,"item":{"key":"9JBLV9M4","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An objective evaluation method for automated vehicle virtual test","abstractNote":"Reasonable test scenarios and objective evaluation methods could rapidly promote the development of autonomous technology.

In order to reduce the participation of experts and implement automatic test evaluation, especially in the virtual environment, an objective automated vehicle evaluation method was proposed. The proposed methodology utilized the idea of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). It combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the improved criteria importance though intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method to determine the weight of the evaluation index. Then the adaptive grey relational analysis (GRA) algorithm was implemented to evaluate the performance of the automated vehicle. The experiment in a virtual environment scenario showed that the evaluation results of the proposed method had high consistency with the traditional human intervention evaluation algorithm.

In this context, flood extent mapping is important for damage and accurate and timely information about flood-affected areas are needed. Due to the suitability of remote sensing in mapping flood inundation, multi-source satellite images have been used in recent years. This paper presents a new approach to representing and modeling uncertainty in spatio-temporal information of satellite images using belief function theory for flooded areas extraction. Interval approaches and the associated arithmetic operations are used for modeling the uncertainty of spatial locations and temporal durations from 2D dimensional model in order to take the direction of flow in the flood. Based on topological spatial relationships, the similarity for the spatio-temporal inundation events is performed and the similar intervals are fused. Detailed examples are given to illustrate each step. A case study of flood risk in Chad Lake from 2003 to 2019 using Sentinel-2, MODIS and Landsat-8 images shows how spatio-temporal uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of even the simplest flood mapping, and how coupling a Dempster–Shafer approach with topological relationships nevertheless offers a useful solution.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422013665","extra":"Citation Key: chehibi2022representing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"209","pages":"118212","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118212","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Chehibi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ahlem","lastName":"Ferchichi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Imed Riadh","lastName":"Farah","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief function theory"},{"tag":"Flood mapping"},{"tag":"Spatial–temporal uncertainty"},{"tag":"Topological spatial relationships"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:17:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9DCDH6D4","itemID":1520,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350274614,"version":0},"$loki":1020},{"itemID":1521,"item":{"key":"ZECJVT7Y","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The similarities and divergences between grey and fuzzy theory","abstractNote":"This article aims to provide the reader with a clearer understanding of the similarities and the divergences that exist between grey and fuzzy theory.

As grey theory generates more popularity, there will evidently be a need to address the issues regarding the similarities.

Due to its unpredictability and destructiveness, the emergency has aroused great common in society. At the same time, the selection of emergency medical supplier is one of the critical links in emergency decision-making, so undertaking appropriate decision-making using scientific tools becomes the primary challenge when an emergency outbreak occurs. The multi criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method is an applicable and common method for choosing supplier. Nevertheless, because emergency medical supplier selection should consider regarding many aspects, it is difficult for decision makers (DMs) to develop a comprehensive assessment method for emergency medical supplier. Therefore, few academics have focused on emergency situation research by the MCGDM method, and the existing MCGDM method has some areas for improvement. In view of this situation, in this study, we propose a new MCGDM method, which considers the bidirectional influence relation of the criteria, consensus and the psychological factors of DMs. It providers a good aid in emergency decision-making and it could apply to other types of MCGDM research. Firstly, DMs give their assessment in interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). Secondly, an extended IT2FSs assessment method and a novel ISM-BWM-Cosine Similarity-Max Deviation Method (IBCSMDM) are used for weighing all alternatives. The TODIM (an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making in Portuguese) can obtain the ranking results under different risk attenuation factors. Eventually, this extended IT2FSs-IBCSMDM-TODIM method is applied in a real case in Wuhan in the context of COVID-19 to illustrate the practicability and usefulness.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422007552","extra":"Citation Key: liu2022extended","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"202","pages":"117414","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117414","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"He","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix T.S.","lastName":"Chan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bidirectional Influence Relation"},{"tag":"Emergency Medical Supplier"},{"tag":"Fuzzy Logic"},{"tag":"MCGDM"},{"tag":"Psychological Factors"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:18:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/S7WNXFMW","itemID":1522,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350295404,"version":0},"$loki":1022},{"itemID":1523,"item":{"key":"DKDKA49S","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Temporal feature aggregation with attention for insider threat detection from activity logs","abstractNote":"Nowadays, insider attacks are emerging as one of the top cybersecurity threats. However, the detection of insider threats is a more arduous task for many reasons. A significant cause is the availability of various data types related to insider activities and their possible behavioral drift. Another major reason is that threat activities rarely happen within any organizational environment and usually remain submerged within a massive amount of normal activities thereby creating data imbalance issues. Any insider threat event requires three major components to get materialized: proper motivation, suitable opportunity and a minimum skill set. The simultaneous occurrence of all these elements is rarely found in organizational environment compared to regular activity traits, and the data imbalance thus caused makes accurate detection of threat activities quite challenging. Existing insider threat detection techniques are mainly divided into statistical rule-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based methods. Although recent deep learning methods have been found to extract intrinsic behavioral properties from users’ activity patterns more effectively than traditional rule-based and machine-learning methods by utilizing their multilayer architecture. But sporadic approaches prioritize critical sections of activity patterns in their detection scheme. Also, rare methods focused on taking advantage of multiple deep learning-based feature extraction models together in their detection process. Finally, rare methods have adequately focused on data imbalance issues, especially over the unequal proportion of different categories of threat instances. In this paper, we proposed an insider threat detection approach using an ensemble of stacked-LSTM and stacked-GRU-based attention models. Our models are first trained on the user’s single-day sequential activity logs. Then a stacked ensemble of trained attention models is used to extract the user’s single-day activity information in the form of the feature vector, which is finally used for classification. To address the data imbalance issues, we propose a new equally-weighted random sampling approach for balancing the population of the different categories of threat patterns. We randomly undersample the nonmalicious instances followed by random oversampling of the different categories of threat instances in an equally-weighted manner so that the training models can learn the behavioral characteristics of the different types of insider activity patterns without getting biased towards any particular type, which is a major limitation of random oversampling and random undersampling-based techniques. Experiments have been performed on the different versions of the CMU CERT insider threat datasets. For robust evaluation, stratified division-based train-test sets have been used based on different categories of insider activities. An average AUC of 0.99 on CMU CERT v4.2 and v5.2 datasets and 0.97 on its v6.2 dataset shows the robustness of the proposed approach in detecting insider threats.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423004268","extra":"Citation Key: pal2023temporal","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"224","pages":"119925","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119925","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Swarnkar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Attention model"},{"tag":"Equally-weighted random sampling"},{"tag":"GRU"},{"tag":"Imbalanced data"},{"tag":"Insider threat"},{"tag":"LSTM"},{"tag":"Stacked ensemble"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:18:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/DKDKA49S","itemID":1523,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350311409,"version":0},"$loki":1023},{"itemID":1524,"item":{"key":"X4B8HE6V","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"3D human action recognition: Through the eyes of researchers","abstractNote":"Human Action Recognition (HAR) has remained one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision.

Firstly, based on the possibility degree of intuitionistic fuzzy values, the possibility degree and divergence degree of IVIFVs are defined to provide a new order relation of IVIFVs. Subsequently in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MAGDM, an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model is constructed to derive decision makers' weights. Depending on the construction of membership and non-membership functions, three approaches are developed to solve the constructed intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model, including the optimistic, pessimistic and mixed approaches. Utilizing decision makers’ weights, the collective decision matrix is obtained. Combining the possibility and divergence degrees of alternatives on attributes, the adjusted possibility distribution matrix for each attribute is constructed and proved to be an interval fuzzy preference relation. Then the attribute weights are determined by the negative distances and the positive distances of adjusted possibility distribution matrices. Using the interval-valued intuitionistic weighted arithmetic aggregation operator, the collective comprehensive values of alternatives are obtained. The ranking order of alternatives is generated according to the proposed order relation of IVIFVs. Therefore, an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MAGDM method is proposed. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on some examples.

Recently, hybrid similarity methods, which incorporate multiple sources of information, have been reported to perform link prediction. However, the applicability of a similarity method to different nodes has not been exploited in the previous hybrid methods. In this regard, we propose a new hybrid algorithm that fuses the results of multiple similarity indexes via the evidence theory. In the proposed algorithm, each similarity index is considered as a source of evidence and the corresponding basic belief assignment (BBA) is derived from the similarity score. More importantly, to adaptively estimate the reliability of evidence, the applicable coefficient (AC) of an index to a node is computed. Then, the BBA of a node pair with respect to a similarity index is discounted according to the ACs of the index to two endpoints. The connection probability of the node pair is gauged by fusing multiple discounted BBAs. Experimental results based on several real-world networks suggest that the proposed method is superior to individual similarity indexes and baseline methods.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422015068","extra":"Citation Key: fang2022evidential","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"210","pages":"118397","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118397","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shiyu","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Longjie","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Binyan","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Evidence theory"},{"tag":"Complex networks"},{"tag":"Hybrid method"},{"tag":"Link prediction"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:19:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3WHUXS2J","itemID":1480,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350394584,"version":0},"$loki":1026},{"itemID":1526,"item":{"key":"YZ678R29","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Top-K interesting preference rules mining based on MaxClique","abstractNote":"In order to fully considered context constraints and eliminate the redundancy of preferences in the personalized queries in the database, a Top-K conditional preference mining framework based on maximal clique is proposed.

Based on this model, we design a MPM algorithm to efficiently obtain users contextual preferences by using graphic model and new pruning strategies.

To tackle above issues, we propose a distributed evidential clustering algorithm that can be directly adopted on the raw big data, and parallelize it under the Apache Spark, which is a processing engine built for sophisticated data analysis. Concretely, in a parallel way, the possibility of becoming a cluster center is first calculated for each data object under the framework of evidence theory.

Without simplifying the data structure, the proposed algorithm can not only detect the number of clusters, but also describe the ambiguity and uncertainty in memberships of every data object. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and one real-world problem show the strong scalability and well clustering performance of the introduced algorithm.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421015876","extra":"Citation Key: gong2022distributed","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"191","pages":"116279","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116279","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Chaoyu","lastName":"Gong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhi-gang","lastName":"Su","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pei-hong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"You","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Apache spark"},{"tag":"Big data"},{"tag":"Distributed calculation"},{"tag":"Evidential clustering"},{"tag":"Warped dissimilarity measure"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:20:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CR5CQZGY","itemID":1481,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350443677,"version":0},"$loki":1028},{"itemID":1527,"item":{"key":"GS2MIHCH","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A FMEA based novel intuitionistic fuzzy approach proposal: Intuitionistic fuzzy advance MCDM and mathematical modeling integration","abstractNote":"This study proposes a novel three-stage intuitionistic fuzzy risk assessment (RA) approach based on Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). In this study, it was paid attention for considering real constraints of firms such as capital, time etc. to prevent nan-fatal failure modes (FMs), interactions between FMs and risk level similarities created by risk factors (RFs). At the first stage of the proposed approach, RFs’ weights are computed by a new intuitionistic fuzzy weighting method considering similarities between RFs for risk levels that they can create. At the second stage, Modified Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi Attribute Border Approximation Area (MIF-MABAC) including interactions between FMs is used to determine the rankings of FMs by using Extended Haussdorff distance function. At the third stage, two intuitionistic fuzzy mathematical models are established to show the effect of the real constraints of the firm to identify the risk types (RTs) that must be avoided primarily. It was seen that the first model gives the same ranking results with the MIF-MABAC. Additionally, when including the real constraints, the first model can give the more suitable results than the second model. The results obtained from the first model show that experts’ assessments and mathematical modeling identify the same FMs for preventing primarily. This study is the first one to suggest a new RA approach that reflects the real constraints of the firms to RA. Additionally, this is the first study that models’ interactions between FMs and risk level similarities created by RFs.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421008332","extra":"Citation Key: yener2021fmea","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"183","pages":"115413","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115413","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yelda","lastName":"Yener","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gülin Feryal","lastName":"Can","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"MABAC"},{"tag":"Intuitionistic fuzzy sets"},{"tag":"Mathematical modeling"},{"tag":"Risk assessment"},{"tag":"Risk factors"},{"tag":"Risk types"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:21:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GS2MIHCH","itemID":1527,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350470219,"version":0},"$loki":1029},{"itemID":1528,"item":{"key":"QVAX58UV","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Repair equipment allocation problem for a support-and-repair ship on a deep sea: A hybrid multi-criteria decision making and optimization approach","abstractNote":"To address the repair equipment allocation problem for a support-and-repair ship on a deep sea, a hybrid multi-criteria decision making and optimization approach is designed.

Most of the current solutions depend on reliable data, deterministic rules, or the similarity of patients, while studies have shown otherwise. To this end, in this paper, we have extended our previous work on the Hapicare framework to integrate probabilistic diagnosis and self-adaptive treatment. Our new framework enables sensors’ datastream analysis and online decision-making. Its ontology-based reasoning uses Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) ontology to add contextual information to the collected data. Moreover, probabilistic reasoning is applied for diagnosis and screening to manage the uncertainty and unreliability of data as well as the indeterministic medical rules. The treatment system is designed to be modifiable by the experts and automatically adaptable to patients’ needs. The probabilistic diagnosis performance has been evaluated based on two public datasets regarding symptoms and risk factors of two chronic diseases: chronic kidney disease and dermatologic disease. The results show that our solution outperforms a classical classifier specifically when more than 40% of the data are missing. The proposed framework is also validated using four scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to help patients and doctors diagnose and treat medical conditions and episodes.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742101126X","extra":"Citation Key: kordestani2021extended","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"186","pages":"115749","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115749","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Hossain","lastName":"Kordestani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roghayeh","lastName":"Mojarad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdelghani","lastName":"Chibani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Barkaoui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Amirat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wagdy","lastName":"Zahran","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Answer set programming"},{"tag":"Bayesian reasoning"},{"tag":"Medical telemonitoring"},{"tag":"Self-adaptive systems"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:21:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CF68QF8M","itemID":1483,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350510658,"version":0},"$loki":1031},{"itemID":1529,"item":{"key":"NAML5Z3P","version":5517,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A cross-disciplinary comparison of multimodal data fusion approaches and applications: Accelerating learning through trans-disciplinary information sharing","abstractNote":"Multimodal data fusion (MMDF) is the process of combining disparate data streams (of different dimensionality, resolution, type, etc.) to generate information in a form that is more understandable or usable. Despite the explosion of data availability in recent decades, as yet there is no well-developed theoretical basis for multimodal data fusion, i.e., no way to determine a priori which approach is best suited to combine an arbitrary set of available data to achieve a stated goal for a given application. This has resulted in exploration of a wide variety of approaches across numerous domains but as yet very little integration of conclusions at a meta (cross-disciplinary) level. In response, this manuscript poses the following questions: (1) How convergent (or divergent) are approaches within single disciplines? (2) How similar are the challenges posed across different disciplines, i.e., might there be opportunity for successes in MMDF achieved in one field to inform progress in other areas as well? and (3) Where are the outstanding gaps in MMDF research, and what does this imply as targets for high impact research in the coming years? To begin to answer these questions, an apples-to-apples comparison of the literature of nine stakeholder-centric engineering domains (civil engineering, transportation, energy, environmental engineering, food engineering, critical care (healthcare), neuroscience, manufacturing/automation, and robotics) was created by quantifying the numbers and dimensionalities of modalities and sensors in each published project and classifying the algorithms used and purposes for which they are used. Within disciplines, it is shown there is often a tendency for use of similar methodologies, both in choice of level of fusion and data algorithm class. Yet this analysis also reveals that many problem types (defined by data dimensionality, modality number and type, and fusion purpose) are shared across different domains and are approached differently in those domains, e.g., transportation problems have similar characteristics to critical care, food science, robotics, and civil engineering. Of the disciplines studied, most (¿75%) share problem characteristics with 3–5 others; to support leveraging these resources, lookup tables indexed by data dimensions, number of modalities, etc. are provided as a starting point for cross-disciplinary MMDF literature searches for new applications. Critical gaps identified are (1) a drop off of the number of published studies with increasing number of distinct modalities and (2) a dearth of publications tackling challenges with high dimensionality inputs, especially time-series 2D and 3D data. These gaps may point to topics where algorithm development will be fruitful to enable future solutions as video and other high-dimensionality sensors decrease in price. Finally, the lack of a shared vocabulary across disciplines makes analyses like the one conducted here challenging, as does the often implicit incorporation of expert knowledge into design; therefore progress toward a better leveraging of the current state of knowledge and toward a theoretical MMDF framework depends critically on improved cross-disciplinary communication and coordination on this topic.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306886","extra":"Citation Key: bokade2021crossdisciplinary","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"165","pages":"113885","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113885","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Bokade","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Navato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ruilin","lastName":"Ouyang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoning","lastName":"Jin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chun-An","lastName":"Chou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Ostadabbas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amy V.","lastName":"Mueller","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Big data"},{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Complex systems"},{"tag":"Multimodal data fusion"},{"tag":"Trans-disciplinary"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:22:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NAML5Z3P","itemID":1529,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350531131,"version":0},"$loki":1032},{"itemID":1530,"item":{"key":"VFJYWV7U","version":6221,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evidence-based decision-making: On the use of systematicity cases to check the compliance of reviews with reporting guidelines such as PRISMA 2020","abstractNote":"Background and context Systematic reviews aim to provide high-quality evidence-based syntheses for efficacy under real-world conditions and allow understanding the correlations between exposures and outcomes. They are increasingly popular and have several stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, researchers, educators, students, journal editors, policy makers, managers) to whom they help make informed recommendations for practice or policy. Problem Systematic reviews usually exhibit low methodological and reporting quality. To tackle this, reporting guidelines have been developed to support systematic reviews reporting and assessment. Following such guidelines is crucial to ensure that a review is transparent, complete, trustworthy, reproducible, and unbiased. However, systematic reviewers usually fail to adhere to existing reporting guidelines, which may significantly decrease the quality of the reviews they report and may result in systematic reviews that lack methodological rigor, yield low-credible findings and may mislead decision-makers. Methods To assure that a review complies with reporting guidelines, we rely on assurance cases that are an emerging way of arguing and relaying various safety–critical systems’ requirements in an extensive manner, as well as checking the compliance of such systems with standards to support their certification. Since the nature of assurance cases makes them applicable to various domains and requirements/properties, we therefore propose a new type of assurance cases called systematicity cases. Systematicity cases focus on the systematicity property and allow arguing that a review is systematic i.e., that it sufficiently complies with the targeted reporting guideline. The most widespread reporting guidelines include PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses). We measure the confidence in a systematicity case representing a review as a means to quantify the systematicity of that review i.e., the extent to which that review is systematic. We rely on rule-based Artificial Intelligence to create a knowledge-based system that automatically supports the inference mechanism that a given systematicity case embodies and that allows making a decision regarding the systematicity of a given review. Results An empirical evaluation performed on 25 reviews (self-identifying as systematic) showed that these reviews exhibit a suboptimal systematicity. More specifically, the systematicity of the analyzed reviews varies between 32.96% and 66.49% and its average is 54.42%. More efforts are therefore needed to report systematic reviews of higher quality. More experiments are also needed to further explore the factors hindering and/or assuring the systematicity of reviews. Audience The main beneficiaries of our work are journal reviewers, journal editors, managers, policymakers, researchers, organizations developing reporting guidelines, peer reviewers, students, insurers, evidence users, as well as reporting guidelines developers.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000702","extra":"Citation Key: boayebelle2023evidencebased","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"217","pages":"119569","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119569","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Alvine","lastName":"Boaye Belle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yixi","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Artificial intelligence"},{"tag":"Assurance cases (systematicity cases)"},{"tag":"Knowledge representation and reasoning"},{"tag":"Knowledge-based systems"},{"tag":"PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses) statement"},{"tag":"Reporting guideline adherence"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:22:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/VFJYWV7U","itemID":1530,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350566786,"version":0},"$loki":1033},{"itemID":1484,"item":{"key":"ZHHG3XIR","version":6221,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A benchmark of machine learning approaches for credit score prediction","abstractNote":"Credit risk assessment plays a key role for correctly supporting financial institutes in defining their bank policies and commercial strategies. Over the last decade, the emerging of social lending platforms has disrupted traditional services for credit risk assessment. Through these platforms, lenders and borrowers can easily interact among them without any involvement of financial institutes. In particular, they support borrowers in the fundraising process, enabling the participation of any number and size of lenders. However, the lack of lenders’ experience and missing or uncertain information about borrower’s credit history can increase risks in social lending platforms, requiring an accurate credit risk scoring. To overcome such issues, the credit risk assessment problem of financial operations is usually modeled as a binary problem on the basis of debt’s repayment and proper machine learning techniques can be consequently exploited. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking study of some of the most used credit risk scoring models to predict if a loan will be repaid in a P2P platform. We deal with a class imbalance problem and leverage several classifiers among the most used in the literature, which are based on different sampling techniques. A real social lending platform (Lending Club) data-set, composed by 877,956 samples, has been used to perform the experimental analysis considering different evaluation metrics (i.e. AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity), also comparing the obtained outcomes with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the three best approaches have also been evaluated in terms of their explainability by means of different eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420307636","extra":"Citation Key: moscato2021benchmark","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"165","pages":"113986","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113986","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Moscato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Picariello","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Sperlí","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Benchmark"},{"tag":"Credit score prediction"},{"tag":"Explainable artificial intelligence"},{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Supervised learning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:22:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZHHG3XIR","itemID":1484,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350566802,"version":0},"$loki":1034},{"itemID":1532,"item":{"key":"FBUMYTAQ","version":5517,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The power of ensemble learning in sentiment analysis","abstractNote":"An ensemble of models is a set of learning models whose individual predictions are combined in such a way that component models compensate for each other’s weaknesses.

Moreover, much of the research activity on ensemble learning is centred around homogeneous ensembles, although heterogeneous ensembles may prove very useful when combining pre-trained models, which are often readily available. In this paper, several techniques for constructing heterogeneous ensembles are applied and comparatively evaluated in respect of benchmark sentiment classification data sets across four different domains. Median performance improvements of up to 5.53% over the best individual model are observed for several ensemble configurations in respect of all four validation data sets, and clear trends are identified that may prove useful to other researchers in the field. Furthermore, a novel ensemble selection approach is proposed that avoids the storage of individual predictions, as well as the costly retraining of all candidate models for an ensemble, that are often required by other similar approaches.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421011854","extra":"Citation Key: kazmaier2022power","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"187","pages":"115819","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115819","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Jacqueline","lastName":"Kazmaier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan H.","lastName":"van Vuuren","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ensemble learning"},{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Sentiment analysis"},{"tag":"Natural language processing"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:23:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FBUMYTAQ","itemID":1532,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350604784,"version":0},"$loki":1035},{"itemID":1488,"item":{"key":"INZIA6VY","version":6225,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Construction of partner selection criteria in sustainable supply chains: A systematic optimization model","abstractNote":"With the recent emphasis on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by both companies, consumers and governments, selecting eco-economic partners is more important than ever. Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach with a case study of a Chinese electronic and equipment manufacturer.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742030467X","extra":"Citation Key: wu2020construction","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"158","pages":"113643","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113643","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hubert","lastName":"Pun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chuanlin","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Criteria interrelationship analysis"},{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Genetic algorithm"},{"tag":"Partner selection"},{"tag":"Sustainable supply chain"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:24:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/INZIA6VY","itemID":1488,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350702219,"version":0},"$loki":1038},{"itemID":1489,"item":{"key":"BLSFYEQV","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Tolerance framework for robust group multiple criteria decision making","abstractNote":"A tolerance framework is developed to address a group multiple criteria ranking problem with indirect preference information, which is referred to as the interaction, importance and tolerance of criteria as well as pairwise comparisons among alternatives and criteria. Choquet integral preference model is employed to capture the interaction, importance and tolerance of criteria, all of which are specific to decision makers (DMs). Some mandatory/sufficient requirements concerning criteria which are global or local, also called the tolerance attitudes of DMs, are quantified as tolerability constraints. Preference disaggregation analysis is extended to solve this type of tolerability constraints for preference elicitation. Confronted with the inconsistency issue (the feasibility of the whole preference constraints translated from indirect preference information), cause oriented strategy and consequence oriented strategy are established by regression-based mixed 0–1 integer linear programs with the objectives of the most credible minimal inconsistent preference constraints and the most credible maximal preference constraints in the context of group decision making. Considering a wide range of the minimal unsatisfied subsets of preference constraints responsible for the inconsistency and the maximum satisfied subsets of preference constraints as a consistent result, to reach a robust decision, stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA)-like simulation analysis is generated to examine the whole instances of compatible preference models in the modified feasible preference polyhedron and compute the result in a probabilistic form. Simulation experiment is conducted to investigate the influence of global tolerance attitudes of DMs on preference elicitation in conservative and radical scenarios. Finally, the application of the proposed approach to a credit ranking of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the comparison analysis with objective methods are presented and discussed for the effectiveness of the proposed tolerance framework.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422013641","extra":"Citation Key: yang2022tolerance","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"208","pages":"118208","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118208","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yelin","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George Q.","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weihao","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Choquet integral preference model"},{"tag":"Monte-Carlo simulation"},{"tag":"Robust group multiple criteria decision making"},{"tag":"Tolerance framework"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:25:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BLSFYEQV","itemID":1489,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350736559,"version":0},"$loki":1039},{"itemID":1491,"item":{"key":"L477ZB2L","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multiple-criteria decision-making sorting methods: A survey","abstractNote":"Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a complex process. It aims to support decision makers in making their decisions more effective and consistent. MCDM provides a useful and successful alternative for handling three main types of MCDM problems, namely, choosing, ranking and sorting. The first two are the most common problems studied but the third offers a way to deal with real world MCDM problems that require alternatives to be assigned to ordered categories. The practitioners are currently developing and applying sorting methods to solve problems from different application areas. In spite of its interest and applicability, there is only one previous review on Multiple-Criteria sorting, performed almost 20 years ago. Hence, because of its interest this paper presents a new and systematic review of MCDM sorting methods that includes 30 years of research in the field. This review has systematically analyzed the conventional and non-classical methods of MCDM sorting and then classified the papers published into 16 application areas. The analysis reveals that the methodological development is still in growth phase for MCDM sorting and discovers the applied methods’ trends. It also shows the complete spectrum of the areas of the application addressed, the state of knowledge about methods, the type of contribution to the knowledge, and the application area for the four categories of the MCDM approaches. The systematic review scrutinizes each selected article in order to find out which approach from the multi-criteria sorting presents the most development based on its contribution and application of the methods. We also aim to discover which Multiple-Criteria sorting methods are the most studied in MCDM. The relevant finding is the relation between the most applied methods and the application areas together with future directions for further research.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421007958","extra":"Citation Key: alvarez2021multiplecriteria","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"183","pages":"115368","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115368","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Pavel Anselmo","lastName":"Alvarez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Ishizaka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Martínez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Multi-criteria decision-making"},{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Decision rules"},{"tag":"Outranking"},{"tag":"Reference level"},{"tag":"Sorting"},{"tag":"Utility functions"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:26:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/L477ZB2L","itemID":1491,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350776242,"version":0},"$loki":1040},{"itemID":1492,"item":{"key":"TZIPNCRD","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dempster-shafer theory and linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy number-based framework for blending knowledge from knowledge repositories: An approach for knowledge management","abstractNote":"Based on Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET) and Linguistic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers (LIFN), this study presents a paradigm for Knowledge Blending (KB) that supports the Knowledge Management (KM) process. The KB framework highlights and analyzes knowledge blending, the emergence of new insights, the ordering of knowledge repositories, and selected knowledge entities that are part of such a knowledge combination. The KB method enables the analysis of knowledge repositories using linguistic terms and quantitative variables and the identification of the ordering of knowledge repositories and specific entities. Ordering knowledge repositories and entities during KB is tricky since knowledge providers employ a range of adjectives, rankings, interpretations, and linguistic terms, rendering the KB process ambiguous. To address the issue, we leverage DSET to describe the LIFNs extracted from knowledge sources as Basic Probability Assignments (BPA). Then, we merge subjective and objective weights obtained from knowledge repositories. To amend evidence from knowledge repositories, we apply the combined weight. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation value of each option is quantified using the combination rule of evidence, which aids in the blending of knowledge repositories and entities acquired from the knowledge repositories. We discuss a case study to explain the proposed method and compare it to other approaches in order to demonstrate its viability and usefulness. The case study highlights the value of KM during the knowledge structuring and auditing stages of the KM process.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005383","extra":"Citation Key: anjaria2022dempstershafer","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"199","pages":"117142","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117142","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Kushal","lastName":"Anjaria","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Knowledge management"},{"tag":"Dempster-shafer evidence theory"},{"tag":"Knowledge blending"},{"tag":"Linguistic Intuitionistic fuzzy number"},{"tag":"Weight combination"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:27:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TZIPNCRD","itemID":1492,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350825834,"version":0},"$loki":1041},{"itemID":1493,"item":{"key":"LKHG96JA","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Decision-making techniques in supplier selection: Recent accomplishments and what lies ahead","abstractNote":"Supplier selection (SS) is considered a sophisticated, application-oriented, decision-making (DM) problem and has received considerable attention.

A lot of attention is paid to situations when in the solution of decision making problem the competing fuzzy classes with intersecting membership functions in antecedent parts of fuzzy rules, e.g., such as Low and Moderate play an important role in the problem formulation. As a result, a new mathematical object “belief interval bounded belief interval” (BIBBI) is obtained. The properties of BIBBI make it possible to use it as a more reliable representation of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value than that formulated in terms of A-IFS. Using the introduced DST based definition of interval-valued A-IFS, the corresponding operations with BIBBIs and the DST representation of rule base evidential reasoning in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting, a new approach to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy extension of rule base evidential reasoning is developed. To prove the correctness and applicability of this approach to the solution of decision making problems, a case study of its use for the type 2 diabetes diagnostics is analyzed.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742200505X","extra":"Citation Key: dymova2022extension","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"201","pages":"117100","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117100","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Ludmila","lastName":"Dymova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kaczmarek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Sevastjanov","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence"},{"tag":"Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy extension"},{"tag":"Rule base evidential reasoning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:28:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/42TZLP47","itemID":1494,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350903340,"version":0},"$loki":1043},{"itemID":1495,"item":{"key":"IW6G455E","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Machine learning with Belief Rule-Based Expert Systems to predict stock price movements","abstractNote":"Price prediction of financial assets has been a key interest for researchers over the decades. Numerous techniques to predict the price movements have been developed by the researchers over the years. But a model loses its credibility once a large number of traders start using the same technique. Therefore, the traders are in continuous search of new and efficient prediction techniques. In this research, we propose a novel machine learning technique using technical analysis with Belief Rule-Based Expert System (BRBES), and incorporating the concept of Bollinger Band to forecast stock price in the next five days. A Bollinger Event is triggered when the closing price of the stock goes down the Lower Bollinger Band. The BRBES approach has never been applied to stock markets, despite its potential and the appetite of the financial markets for expert systems. We predict the price movement of the Swedish company TELIA as a proof of concept. The knowledge base of the initial BRBES is constructed by simulating the historical data and then the learning parameters are optimized using MATLAB’s fmincon function. We evaluate the performance of the trained BRBES in terms of Accuracy, Area Under ROC Curve, Root Mean Squared Error, type I error, type II error, R2 value, and profit/loss ratio. We compare our proposed model against a similar rule-based technique, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), to understand the significance of the improved rule base of BRBES. We also compare the performance against Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most popular machine learning techniques, and a simple heuristic model. Finally, the trained BRBES is compared against recent state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to show how competitive the performance of our proposed model is. The results show that the trained BRBES produces better performance than the non-trained BRBES, ANFIS, SVM, and the heuristic approaches. Also, it indicates better or competitive performance against the deep learning approaches. Thus BRBES exhibits its potential in predicting financial asset price movement.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422009940","extra":"Citation Key: hossain2022machine","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"206","pages":"117706","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117706","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Emam","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad Shahadat","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pär-Ola","lastName":"Zander","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Andersson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Belief rule"},{"tag":"Bollinger band"},{"tag":"Expert system"},{"tag":"Stock prediction"},{"tag":"Time series analysis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:29:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IW6G455E","itemID":1495,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350956502,"version":0},"$loki":1044},{"itemID":1496,"item":{"key":"GEN3E6QA","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Identifying the influential contributing factors to micro-enterprises’ workplace accidents using a hybrid D-DEMATEL-IFISM method","abstractNote":"Introduction Micro-enterprises are acknowledged as one of the most high-risk workplaces often due to poor safety practices and performance. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce these workplace accidents, they remain as a serious problem. Therefore, understanding the relationship between the contributing factors to workplace accidents in micro-enterprises remains a key area of interest for safety professionals. Method This paper presents a new integrated approach comprised of a D number Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (D-DEMATEL) technique, and an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (IFISM) technique. The DEMATEL technique is applied to determine the cause-and-effect relationships of contributing factors, and D number theory is applied to take into account their uncertain characteristics. Lastly the IFISM technique is used to examine the hierarchical structure of driver-driven relationships. Results Results showed that sixteen factors contribute to the micro-enterprises’ workplace accidents in which “repairing or maintaining equipment under unsafe conditions” and “improper use of tools” are the most important causes. The hierarchal structure analysis showed that the root and basic causes of micro-enterprises’ workplace accidents based on the ISM method were the “improper use of tools” and “repairing or maintaining equipment under unsafe conditions”. Conclusions This study is the first of its kind to propose a hybrid D-DEMATEL–IFISM method for identifying and evaluating the contributing factors affecting the occurrence of workplace accidents in micro-enterprises. The new method allows insights on contributing factors to be based not only importance, intensity and impact of each identified contributing factor but also on the relationship amongst the contributing factors. Practical application The study presents key information on the main contributing factors to micro enterprise workplace accidents. These results provide safety professionals with evidence which can be used to focus safety efforts, with a view to reducing workplace accidents in micro enterprises.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422004730","extra":"Citation Key: khorasane2022identifying","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"200","pages":"117059","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117059","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Maryam Amiri","lastName":"Khorasane","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Alimohammadlou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Klockner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Kamalinia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Jahangiri","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"D-DEMATEL"},{"tag":"IF-ISM"},{"tag":"Influential factor"},{"tag":"Micro-enterprises"},{"tag":"Workplace accident"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:29:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GEN3E6QA","itemID":1496,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683350980939,"version":0},"$loki":1045},{"itemID":1497,"item":{"key":"9VR62YYU","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Best practices in analytic network process studies","abstractNote":"It has been more than 20 years since the appearance of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) in the scientific literature.

It is one of the priorities in health. An increase in the number of the health services provided leads to an increase in the amount of HCW, which has particularly been noticeable in recent years. Since this is the waste that may pose a risk to humans and the environment, it is necessary to ensure an adequate treatment of the same. HCW management is particularly important in developing countries, due to inappropriate disposal methods, underfunding and a lack of the infrastructure. In order to achieve the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of this area, HCW should be minimized through an adequate treatment of the same. The Public Enterprise Zdravstvo Brčko (Brčko Health System) has intensively been addressing the HCW management issue. They have decided to upgrade the HCW system by purchasing a new infectious waste treatment facility. The paper is aimed at creating a new original integrated multicriteria decision-making model based on D numbers for processing fuzzy linguistic information. This model will serve to support management in the procurement of the mentioned facility. The model integrates the benefits of different approaches and theories. An initial model was formed, consisting of the six potential solutions evaluated based on the 18 criteria classified into the following four groups: social, environmental, economic and technological. Four experts in this field evaluated the criteria and potential solutions. Then, a new Best-Worst Method based on D numbers (BWM-D) was applied in order to determine the significance of the criteria. After that, a Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison Based on D numbers (MABAC-D) was developed and applied so as to evaluate and select an infectious waste treatment facility. The results have shown that the alternative A1 gives the best results, whereas the alternative A5 shows the worst results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the obtained results. In this part of the paper, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS-D) and VIšekriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisnog Rešenja (VIKOR-D) were developed in order to validate the results. When procuring a new Contagious Waste Treatment System, the characteristics of the available devices need be perceived and all the criteria need be taken into account in order to provide a device which will solve the HCW problem in the best way. This paper has shown how D numbers can be used when making a selection of an HCW management device, and also how all the characteristics of such a device can be perceived and how the device demonstrating the best characteristics can be selected.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421003031","extra":"Citation Key: pamucar2021new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"175","pages":"114862","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114862","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamučar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adis","lastName":"Puška","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Željko","lastName":"Stević","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Ćirović","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BWM"},{"tag":"D numbers"},{"tag":"Fuzzy linguistic variable"},{"tag":"MABAC"},{"tag":"Waste management"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:30:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3II5P6BI","itemID":1498,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351007593,"version":0},"$loki":1047},{"itemID":1499,"item":{"key":"9P6LASJY","version":6236,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Machine learning based methods for software fault prediction: A survey","abstractNote":"Several prediction approaches are contained in the arena of software engineering such as prediction of effort, security, quality, fault, cost, and re-usability. All these prediction approaches are still in the rudimentary phase. Experiments and research are conducting to build a robust model. Software Fault Prediction (SFP) is the process to develop the model which can be utilized by software practitioners to detect faulty classes/module before the testing phase. Prediction of defective modules before the testing phase will help the software development team leader to allocate resources more optimally and it reduces the testing effort. In this article, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of various studies from 1990 to June 2019 towards applying machine learning and statistical method over software fault prediction. We have cited 208 research articles, in which we studied 154 relevant articles. We investigated the competence of machine learning in existing datasets and research projects. To the best of our knowledge, the existing SLR considered only a few parameters over SFP’s performance, and they partially examined the various threats and challenges of SFP techniques. In this article, we aggregated those parameters and analyzed them accordingly, and we also illustrate the different challenges in the SFP domain. We also compared the performance between machine learning and statistical techniques based on SFP models. Our empirical study and analysis demonstrate that the prediction ability of machine learning techniques for classifying class/module as fault/non-fault prone is better than classical statistical models. The performance of machine learning-based SFP methods over fault susceptibility is better than conventional statistical purposes. The empirical evidence of our survey reports that the machine learning techniques have the capability, which can be used to identify fault proneness, and able to form well-generalized result. We have also investigated a few challenges in fault prediction discipline, i.e., quality of data, over-fitting of models, and class imbalance problem.

Ambiguity and incompleteness due to missing values in output and input attributes, respectively, is ubiquitous in these domains. It could have an adverse impact on a certain unrepresented set of people in the training data without a developer’s intention to discriminate. The inherently non-numerical nature of categorical attributes than numerical attributes and the presence of incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes in a dataset increases the uncertainty in decision-making. This paper addresses the challenges in handling categorical attributes as it is not addressed comprehensively in previous research. Three sources of uncertainties in categorical attributes are recognised in this research. The informational uncertainty, unforeseeable uncertainty in the decision task environment, and the uncertainty due to lack of pre-modelling explainability in categorical attributes are addressed in the proposed methodology on maximum likelihood evidential reasoning (MAKER). It can transform and impute incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes into interpretable numerical features. It utilises a notion of weight and reliability to include subjective expert preference over a piece of evidence and the quality of evidence in a categorical attribute, respectively. The MAKER framework strives to integrate the recognised uncertainties in the transformed input data that allow a model to perceive data limitations during the training regime and acknowledge doubtful predictions by supporting trustworthy pre-modelling and post modelling explainability. The ability to handle uncertainty and its impact on explainability is demonstrated on a real-world healthcare and finance data for different missing data scenarios in three types of AI algorithms: deep-learning, tree-based, and rule-based model.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009970","extra":"Citation Key: sachan2021evidential","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"185","pages":"115597","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115597","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Swati","lastName":"Sachan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fatima","lastName":"Almaghrabi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong-Ling","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Uncertainty"},{"tag":"Categorical"},{"tag":"Decision-making"},{"tag":"Evidential reasoning"},{"tag":"Trustworthy"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:31:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/S8BDDLUG","itemID":1500,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351083357,"version":0},"$loki":1049},{"itemID":1501,"item":{"key":"7YE27I5N","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Supplier selection in sustainable supply chains: Using the integrated BWM, fuzzy Shannon entropy, and fuzzy MULTIMOORA methods","abstractNote":"With the increasing awareness of environmental protection and social responsibility, sustainable supplier selection (SSS) has been receiving more and more attention. However, traditional methods for selecting sustainable suppliers suffer from three main drawbacks: (i) Few existing studies have considered criteria weightings that have been determined both subjectively and objectively, reasonably and simultaneously. Moreover, among these limited studies, existing methods for combining weightings that have been calculated both subjectively and objectively provide only a poor degree of differentiation. (ii) Although MULTIMOORA method has high potential to solve the complex SSS problem, few researchers have given it much attention. (iii) The current Reference Point Approach within MULTIMOORA is not comprehensive as it only considers the distance between the alternative and the positive ideal point. Together, these drawbacks result in both inefficiency and ineffectiveness in SSS. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy MULTIMOORA-based method for SSS. The proposed method, firstly, obtains weights by both group Best Worst Method (subjective method) and fuzzy Shannon Entropy Method (objective method), respectively. Then the two types of weights are combined by Deviation Maximization method, reasonably and effectively. Finally, the paper introduces an improved fuzzy MULTIMOORA method to rank alternative suppliers, which considers both the minimum distance from the positive ideal point and the maximum distance from the negative ideal point. The practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in an illustrative application in Company L, a well-known international forklift truck manufacturer in China.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422000653","extra":"Citation Key: shang2022supplier","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"195","pages":"116567","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116567","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Shang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Barnes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Sustainable supply chain"},{"tag":"Supplier selection"},{"tag":"Fuzzy Shannon entropy"},{"tag":"Group BWM"},{"tag":"MULTIMOORA"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:31:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7YE27I5N","itemID":1501,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351102473,"version":0},"$loki":1050},{"itemID":1502,"item":{"key":"3QWSAKS2","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Estimation of the qualification and behavior of a contributor and aggregation of his answers in a crowdsourcing context","abstractNote":"Crowdsourcing is the outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of contributors on a dedicated platform. The crowd on these platforms is very diversified and includes various profiles of contributors which generates data of uneven quality. However, majority voting, which is the aggregating method commonly used in platforms, gives equal weight to each contribution. To overcome this problem, we propose a method, MONITOR, which estimates the contributor’s profile and aggregates the collected data by taking into account their possible imperfections thanks to the theory of belief functions. To do so, MONITOR starts by estimating the profile of the contributor through his qualification for the task and his behavior. Crowdsourcing campaigns have been carried out to collect the necessary data to test MONITOR on real data in order to compare it to existing approaches. The results of the experiments show that thanks to the use of the MONITOR method, we obtain a better rate of correct answer after aggregation of the contributions compared to the majority voting. Our contributions in this article are for the first time the proposal of a model that takes into account both the qualification of the contributor and his behavior in the estimation of his profile.

In the BFT, a lot of rules to combine the available pieces of evidence have been proposed. The first one of them was Dempster’s rule of combination (DRC). It presents several drawbacks principally motivated by the normalization process used via a measure of conflict-based-combination between two pieces of evidence. This measure must be differentiated from conflict as an uncertainty-based-information measure of a piece of evidence in BFT. Many combination rules have been developed to solve the drawbacks that DRC presents, but each of them also has non-desirable behaviors in certain situations. In this work, we propose a set of mathematical properties that must be satisfied by every combination rule in BFT; we analyze some of the most known combination rules proposed in the literature, taking into account properties and behaviors. On the other hand, in this research, we present a new hybrid rule that verifies the required mathematical properties and does not present undesirable behaviors that other rules suffer. Finally, we show that the results of our proposal when it is used in practical applications are coherent.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421004280","extra":"Citation Key: abellan2021combination","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"178","pages":"114987","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114987","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Serafín","lastName":"Moral-García","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"María D.","lastName":"Benítez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Conflict"},{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Combination rules"},{"tag":"Decision support systems"},{"tag":"Hybrid rules"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:33:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/88P7JT9C","itemID":1504,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351239902,"version":0},"$loki":1053},{"itemID":1505,"item":{"key":"L4PGSR3G","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for data with unequal cluster sizes and contaminated with noise and outliers: Review and development","abstractNote":"Clustering algorithms aim at finding dense regions of data based on similarities and dissimilarities of data points. Noise and outliers contribute to the computational procedure of the algorithms as well as the actual data points that leads to inaccurate and misplaced cluster centers. This problem also arises when sizes of the clusters are different that moves centers of small clusters towards large clusters. Mass of the data points is important as well as their location in engineering and physics where non-uniform mass distribution results displacement of the cluster centers towards heavier clusters even if sizes of the clusters are identical and the data are noise-free. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm that suffers from these problems is the most popular fuzzy clustering algorithm and has been subject of numerous researches and developments though improvements are still marginal. This work revises the FCM algorithm to make it applicable to data with unequal cluster sizes, noise and outliers, and non-uniform mass distribution. Revised FCM (RFCM) algorithm employs adaptive exponential functions to eliminate impacts of noise and outliers on the cluster centers and modifies constraint of the FCM algorithm to prevent large or heavier clusters from attracting centers of small clusters. Several algorithms are reviewed and their mathematical structures are discussed in the paper including Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM), Possibilistic C-Means (PCM), Robust Fuzzy C-Means (FCM-σ), Noise Clustering (NC), Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM), Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM), Robust Kernel Fuzzy C-Mean (KFCM-σ), Robust Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM-σ), Kernel Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (KIFCM), Robust Kernel Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (KIFCM-σ), Credibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM), Size-insensitive integrity-based Fuzzy C-Means (siibFCM), Size-insensitive Fuzzy C-Means (csiFCM), Subtractive Clustering (SC), Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Spectral clustering, and Outlier Removal Clustering (ORC). Some of these algorithms are suitable for noisy data and some others are designed for data with unequal clusters. The study shows that the RFCM algorithm works for both cases and outperforms the both categories of the algorithms.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306679","extra":"Citation Key: askari2021fuzzy","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"165","pages":"113856","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113856","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Salar","lastName":"Askari","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Clustering"},{"tag":"FCM"},{"tag":"Fuzzy C-Means"},{"tag":"Noise"},{"tag":"Outlier"},{"tag":"Unequal clusters"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:34:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/L4PGSR3G","itemID":1505,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351257493,"version":0},"$loki":1054},{"itemID":1506,"item":{"key":"INYTIQGI","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A portfolio construction model based on sector analysis using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and Granger causal network: An application to National stock exchange of India","abstractNote":"With the emerging areas of economy, the diverse sector-based investment portfolios are considered more significant. This paper presents an integrated approach of portfolio construction based on sector analysis for investment in National Stock Exchange of India. The model is developed in four stages: First, multiple evidences are collected using historical data to analyze the performance of different sectors, and ranked using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The top-ranked sectors are considered as the strong sectors. Second, Granger causality test is employed for determining interdependencies between the strong sectors using the past closing price time series. Then, the strong sectors with no causal relationships are selected to diversify the investment. Third, leading stocks of the selected sectors are picked on the basis on their performance in previous years. Thus, the portfolio of best stocks from strong and diverse sectors is constructed. Fourth, for optimizing of the constructed portfolio or to obtain optimal ratio allocations of stocks in the portfolio, an optimization function is constructed and simulated using a deep recurrent neural network. The results obtained by the proposed portfolio are found very significant which confirms its effectiveness. The applicability of the proposed model is verified by empirical study over the existing models.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422024538","extra":"Citation Key: bisht2023portfolio","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"215","pages":"119434","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119434","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Bisht","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Deep recurrent neural network"},{"tag":"Granger causality"},{"tag":"Portfolio construction"},{"tag":"Sector analysis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:34:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/INYTIQGI","itemID":1506,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351265683,"version":0},"$loki":1055},{"itemID":1507,"item":{"key":"QQTXPKXU","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"How much do the central bank announcements matter on financial market?

Hence, the paper proposed a new probability transform method based on the ordered weighted averaging and entropy diﬀerence. The new method calculates weights by ordered weighted averaging, and adds entropy diﬀerence as one of the measurement indicators.

However, the uncertainty measure of a basic probability assignment (BPA) is still an open issue in DST. There are many methods to quantify the uncertainty of BPAs. However, the existing methods have some limitations. In this paper, a new total uncertainty measure from a perspective of maximum entropy requirement is proposed. The proposed method can measure both dissonance and non-speciﬁcity in BPA, which includes two components. The ﬁrst component is consistent with Yager’s dissonance measure. The second component is the non-speciﬁcity measurement with different functions. We also prove the desirable properties of the proposed method. Besides, numerical examples and applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed total uncertainty measure.","date":"2021-08-17","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"物理与天体物理3区","libraryCatalog":"物理：综合3区","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/8/1061","accessDate":"2022-12-27T14:42:43Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2021new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"23","pages":"1061","publicationTitle":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23081061","issue":"8","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Entropy","ISSN":"1099-4300","creators":[{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fanghui","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-27T14:42:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LA2EQ9IP","itemID":827,"attachments":[{"key":"W4XIFKEX","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhang2021a.md","parentItem":"LA2EQ9IP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhang2021a.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:40:19Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:40:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/W4XIFKEX","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\W4XIFKEX\\@Zhang2021a.md","defaultPath":"files/1083/@Zhang2021a.md"},{"key":"7LGMGHX6","version":6196,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhang_et_al_2021_a_new_total_uncertainty_measure_from_a_perspective_of_maximum_entropy.pdf","parentItem":"LA2EQ9IP","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/zhang_et_al_2021_a_new_total_uncertainty_measure_from_a_perspective_of_maximum_entropy.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/1\">Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/2\">Preliminaries</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/2\">Dempster-Shafer Theory</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/3\">Belief and Plausibility Function</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/3\">Shannon Entropy</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/3\">Some Existing Entropies in DST</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/5\">Proposed Uncertainty Measure in DST</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/5\">The Proposed Method</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/5\">Properties of the Proposed Method</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/7\">Numerical Examples</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/8\">Example 1</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/9\">Example 2</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/10\">Example 3</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/11\">Example 4</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/12\">Example 5</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/13\">Example 6</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/15\">Application</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/18\">Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_7LGMGHX6/18\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:45:00Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:13:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7LGMGHX6","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive -

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of such probability transformations (PTs), which are crucial for their proper applications and the design of new ones. Shannon entropy or probabilistic information content (PIC) measure is traditionally used in evaluating PTs. The transformation having the lowest entropy or highest PIC is considered as the best one. This standpoint is questioned in this paper by comparing a PT based on uncertainty minimization with other available PTs. It shows experimentally that entropy or PIC is not comprehensive to evaluate a PT. To make a comprehensive evaluation, some new approaches are proposed by the joint use of PIC and the distance of evidence according to the value- and rank-based fusion. A pattern classiﬁcation application oriented evaluation approach for PTs is also proposed. Some desired properties for PTs are also discussed. Experimental results and related analysis are provided to show the rationality of the new evaluation approaches.","date":"1/2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7097080/","accessDate":"2023-03-05T13:06:14Z","extra":"Citation Key: han2016evaluation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"46","pages":"93-108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2421883","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

A rational uncertainty measure for belief functions should meet some desirable properties, where monotonicity is a very important property. Recently, measuring the total uncertainty of a belief function based on its associated belief intervals becomes a new research idea and has attracted increasing interest. Several belief interval based uncertainty measures have been proposed for belief functions. In this paper, we summarize the properties of these uncertainty measures and especially investigate whether the monotonicity is satisﬁed by the measures. This study provide a comprehensive comparison to these belief interval based uncertainty measures and is very useful for choosing the appropriate uncertainty measure in the practical applications.","date":"09/2018","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能2区","callNumber":"8.9924","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21999","accessDate":"2023-01-19T06:22:14Z","rights":"8.9264","extra":"Citation Key: deng2018analyzing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"33","pages":"1869-1879","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/int.21999","issue":"9","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Intell Syst","ISSN":"08848173","creators":[{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T06:22:14Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Y8ES2UW5","itemID":856,"attachments":[{"key":"XDLUCALT","version":6044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Deng2018.md","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Deng2018.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:42:51Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:42:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XDLUCALT","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\XDLUCALT\\@Deng2018.md","defaultPath":"files/1178/@Deng2018.md"},{"key":"B2CTBFDU","version":6148,"itemType":"attachment","title":"deng_2018_analyzing_the_monotonicity_of_belief_interval_based_uncertainty_measures_in.pdf","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2018/deng_2018_analyzing_the_monotonicity_of_belief_interval_based_uncertainty_measures_in.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-05T01:46:42Z","dateModified":"2023-05-05T01:46:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/B2CTBFDU","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2018\\deng_2018_analyzing_the_monotonicity_of_belief_interval_based_uncertainty_measures_in.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1658/deng_2018_analyzing_the_monotonicity_of_belief_interval_based_uncertainty_measures_in.pdf"},{"key":"ZK2AKSQG","version":3124,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Deng2018-zotero.md","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\Deng2018-zotero.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:27:12Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:27:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZK2AKSQG","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\Deng2018-zotero.md","defaultPath":"files/870/Deng2018-zotero.md"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683351610435,"version":0},"$loki":1063},{"itemID":1379,"item":{"key":"NPZ4A2W7","version":6182,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Belief functions on ordered frames of discernment","abstractNote":"Most questionnaires offer ordered responses whose order is poorly studied via belief functions.

However, such machine learning models fail to identify the classes, which were not available during training time. These classes can be referred to as\n              unseen classes\n              . Open-world Machine Learning (OWML) is a novel technique, which deals with unseen classes. Although OWML is around for a few years and many significant research works have been carried out in this domain, there is no comprehensive survey of the characteristics, applications, and impact of OWML on the major research areas. In this article, we aimed to capture the different dimensions of OWML with respect to other traditional machine learning models. We have thoroughly analyzed the existing literature and provided a novel taxonomy of OWML considering its two major application domains: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. We listed the available software packages and open datasets in OWML for future researchers. Finally, the article concludes with a set of research gaps, open challenges, and future directions.","date":"2023-10-31","language":"en","shortTitle":"Open-world Machine

Given a ﬁnite set S with |S|= n hypothesis, one property of power set is that the amount of subsets of S is |P (S)|= 2n. However, the physica meaning of power set needs exploration. To address this issue, a possible explanation of power set is proposed in this paper. A power set of n events can be seen as all possible k-combination, where k ranges from 0 to n. It means the power set extends the event space in probability theory into all possible combination of the single basic event. From the view of power set, all subsets or all combination of basic events, are created equal. These subsets are assigned with the mass function, whose uncertainty can be measured by Deng entropy. The relationship between combinatorial number, Pascal’s triangle and power set is revealed by Deng entropy quantitively from the view of information measure.","date":"2021-08-13","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/4413","accessDate":"2022-09-28T14:02:17Z","extra":"Citation Key: song2021entropic","volume":"16","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2021.4.4413","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

RPS takes the permutation of a certain set into consideration, which can be regarded as an ordered extension of evidence theory. Uncertainty is an important feature of RPS. A straightforward question is how to measure the uncertainty of RPS. To address this issue, the entropy of RPS (RPS entropy) is presented in this article. The proposed RPS entropy is compatible with Deng entropy and Shannon entropy. In addition, RPS entropy meets probability consistency, additivity, and subadditivity. Numerical examples are designed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed RPS entropy. Besides, a comparative analysis of the choice of applying RPS entropy, Deng entropy, and Shannon entropy is also carried out.","date":"2023-02-21","language":"en","archive":"Q4","archiveLocation":"数学4区","libraryCatalog":"统计学与概率论4区","callNumber":"0.8631","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03610926.2023.2173975","accessDate":"2023-05-11T02:42:41Z","rights":"0.9189","extra":"Citation Key: chen2023entropy","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"1-19","publicationTitle":"Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods","DOI":"10.1080/03610926.2023.2173975","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Commun Stat-theor M","ISSN":"0361-0926, 1532-415X","creators":[{"firstName":"Luyuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-11T02:42:41Z","dateModified":"2023-05-11T02:43:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CJCFPFF3","itemID":1705,"attachments":[{"key":"BU25QYPG","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@chen2023entropy.md","parentItem":"CJCFPFF3","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@chen2023entropy.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-16T03:08:43Z","dateModified":"2023-05-16T03:08:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BU25QYPG","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@chen2023entropy.md","defaultPath":"files/1753/@chen2023entropy.md"},{"key":"ANVCAX3A","version":6267,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chen_et_al_2023_entropy_of_random_permutation_set.pdf","parentItem":"CJCFPFF3","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2023/chen_et_al_2023_entropy_of_random_permutation_set.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_ANVCAX3A/2\">1.

An important feature of RPS theory is that in the fusion rule of RPS sources, the fusion order has a great impact on fusion results. However, how to determine the fusion order has not yet been discussed. To address this problem, this paper first proposes Permutation Jensen–Shannon (PJS) divergence for measuring the distance between two RPSs. Based on PJS divergence, a new Reliability Assessment algorithm, named RAPJS, is then presented for determining the fusion order of RPSs. The proposed PJS divergence satisfies the properties of non–degeneracy, boundary, and symmetry, and has desirable compatibility with Belief Jensen–Shannon divergence and Jensen–Shannon divergence under certain conditions. The presented RAPJS makes use of the divergence information to calculate the reliability degree of RPS sources, the RPS with a higher reliability is fused first. Experiment results in threat assessment reveal that the presented RAPJS algorithm can determine the fusion order reasonably and effectively. The assessment results using the proposed RAPJS algorithm has the highest target recognition rate compared to other results under different fusion orders.","date":"03/2023","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术2区","libraryCatalog":"自动化与控制系统3区  计算机：人工智能3区  工程：电子与电气2区  工程：综合2区","callNumber":"7.802","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197622006911","accessDate":"2023-04-26T08:57:05Z","rights":"6.694","extra":"Citation Key: chen2023permutation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"119","pages":"105701","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105701","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Eng Appl Artif Intel","ISSN":"09521976","creators":[{"firstName":"Luyuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kang Hao","lastName":"Cheong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-26T08:57:05Z","dateModified":"2023-05-06T05:24:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TRPDFXJQ","itemID":1534,"attachments":[{"key":"HYY77YZD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@chen2023permutation.md","parentItem":"TRPDFXJQ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@chen2023permutation.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-16T03:18:57Z","dateModified":"2023-05-16T03:18:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/HYY77YZD","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@chen2023permutation.md","defaultPath":"files/1755/@chen2023permutation.md"},{"key":"4SISVA77","version":6133,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chen_et_al_2023_permutation_jensen–shannon_divergence_for_random_permutation_set.pdf","parentItem":"TRPDFXJQ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2023/chen_et_al_2023_permutation_jensen–shannon_divergence_for_random_permutation_set.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Here comes the question: what would happen if the combinatorial number is replaced by permutation number? To address this issue, a new kind of set, named as random permutation set (RPS), is proposed in this paper, which consists of permutation event space (PES) and permutation mass function (PMF). The PES of a certain set considers all the permutation of that set. The elements of PES are called the permutation events. PMF describes the chance of a certain permutation event that would happen. Based on PES and PMF, RPS can be viewed as a permutation-based generalization of random ﬁnite set. Besides, the right intersection (RI) and left intersection (LI) of permutation events are presented. Based on RI and LI, the right orthogonal sum (ROS) and left orthogonal sum (LOS) of PMFs are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the proposed conceptions. The comparisons of probability theory, evidence theory, and RPS are discussed and summarized. Moreover, an RPS-based data fusion algorithm is proposed and applied in threat assessment. The experimental results show that the proposed RPS-based algorithm can reasonably and efﬁciently deal with uncertainty in threat assessment with respect to threat ranking and reliability ranking.","date":"2022-01-10","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/4542","accessDate":"2023-03-15T05:30:53Z","extra":"Citation Key: deng2022random","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"17","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2022.1.4542","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

However, how to quantify the information-based uncertainty of basic probability assignment (BPA) with belief entropy in DST framework is still an open issue. The main work of this study is to define a new belief entropy for measuring uncertainty of BPA. The proposed belief entropy has two components. The first component is based on the summation of the probability mass function (PMF) of single events contained in each BPA, which are obtained using plausibility transformation. The second component is the same as the weighted Hartley entropy. The two components could effectively measure the discord uncertainty and non-specificity uncertainty found in DST framework, respectively. The proposed belief entropy is proved to satisfy the majority of the desired properties for an uncertainty measure in DST framework. In addition, when BPA is probability distribution, the proposed method could degrade to Shannon entropy. The feasibility and superiority of the new belief entropy is verified according to the results of numerical experiments.","date":"2019/2","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"物理3区","libraryCatalog":"物理：综合3区","callNumber":"2.7381","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/2/163","accessDate":"2023-05-17T13:30:37Z","rights":"2.6418","extra":"Number: 2\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute\nCitation Key: pan2019novel","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"21","pages":"163","publicationTitle":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e21020163","issue":"2","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Entropy-switz","ISSN":"1099-4300","creators":[{"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yongchuan","lastName":"Tang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jichuan","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"belief entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"plausibility transformation","type":1},{"tag":"Shannon entropy","type":1},{"tag":"uncertainty of basic probability assignment","type":1},{"tag":"weighted Hartley entropy","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-17T13:30:37Z","dateModified":"2023-05-17T13:30:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GQ7E7QZF","itemID":1771,"attachments":[{"key":"3GVJ9RND","version":6586,"itemType":"attachment","title":"pan_et_al_2019_a_novel_belief_entropy_for_measuring_uncertainty_in_dempster-shafer_evidence.pdf","parentItem":"GQ7E7QZF","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2019/pan_et_al_2019_a_novel_belief_entropy_for_measuring_uncertainty_in_dempster-shafer_evidence.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-17T13:30:45Z","dateModified":"2023-05-17T13:30:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3GVJ9RND","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2019\\pan_et_al_2019_a_novel_belief_entropy_for_measuring_uncertainty_in_dempster-shafer_evidence.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1773/pan_et_al_2019_a_novel_belief_entropy_for_measuring_uncertainty_in_dempster-shafer_evidence.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684330260690,"version":0},"$loki":1197},{"itemID":1777,"item":{"key":"YHLVSFK9","version":6604,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Remarks on “Measuring ambiguity in the evidence theory”","date":"2008","extra":"Publisher: IEEE\nCitation Key: klir2008remarks","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"38","pages":"995–999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans","creators":[{"firstName":"George J","lastName":"Klir","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harold W","lastName":"Lewis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/54Y9RMR9"]},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:10:30Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:13:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YHLVSFK9","itemID":1777,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684372405255,"version":0},"$loki":1205},{"itemID":1779,"item":{"key":"H6DA8L4V","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Critique of recent uncertainty measures developed under the evidence theory and belief intervals","date":"2017","extra":"Citation Key: abellan2017critique\nPublisher: IEEE","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"50","pages":"1186–1192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Éloi","lastName":"Bossé","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:13:27Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:13:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/H6DA8L4V","itemID":1779,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684372417499,"version":0},"$loki":1206},{"itemID":1780,"item":{"key":"U3P76E7C","version":6610,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A new definition of entropy of belief functions in the Dempster–Shafer theory","abstractNote":"We propose a new definition of entropy of basic probability assignments (BPAs) in the Dempster–Shafer (DS) theory of belief functions, which is interpreted as a measure of total uncertainty in the BPA. Our definition is different from those proposed by Höhle, Smets, Yager, Nguyen, Dubois–Prade, Lamata–Moral, Klir–Ramer, Klir–Parviz, Pal et al., Maeda–Ichihashi, Harmanec–Klir, Abellán–Moral, Jousselme et al., Pouly et al., and Deng. We state a list of six desired properties of entropy for DS belief functions theory, four of which are motivated by Shannon's definition of entropy of probability functions, and the remaining two are requirements that adapt this measure to the philosophy of the DS theory. Three of our six desired properties are different from the five properties proposed by Klir and Wierman. We demonstrate that our definition satisfies all six properties in our list, whereas none of the existing definitions do. Our new definition has two components. The first component is Shannon's entropy of an equivalent probability mass function obtained using the plausibility transform, which constitutes the conflict measure of entropy. The second component is Dubois–Prade's definition of entropy of basic probability assignments in the DS theory, which constitutes the non-specificity measure of entropy.

How to measure the uncertainty in DS evidence theory precisely remains an outstanding problem. Various types of uncertainty measures for evidence have been presented. However, they all suffer some limitations. To address this issue, we propose a novel total uncertainty measure for the DS evidence theory framework that can quantify the uncertainty in the evidence. The new total uncertainty measure uses the Hellinger distance between the belief interval of every singleton and the most uncertain interval. Compared with the existing uncertainty measurement methods, the proposed approach is more sensitive to changes in evidence. The effectiveness and rationality of the brand new total uncertainty measure are illustrated by numerical examples and practical applications.","date":"2021","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","callNumber":"8.9924","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/int.22358","accessDate":"2023-05-18T01:37:07Z","rights":"8.9264","extra":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/int.22358\nCitation Key: deng2021measuring","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"36","pages":"1721-1745","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/int.22358","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Intell Syst","ISSN":"1098-111X","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianyu","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"belief interval","type":1},{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"Hellinger distance","type":1},{"tag":"uncertainty measurement","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:37:07Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:37:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UACH5VDT","itemID":1788,"attachments":[{"key":"J6RHWW7Y","version":6640,"itemType":"attachment","title":"deng_et_al_2021_measuring_total_uncertainty_in_evidence_theory.pdf","parentItem":"UACH5VDT","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2021/deng_et_al_2021_measuring_total_uncertainty_in_evidence_theory.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:37:26Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:37:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/J6RHWW7Y","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2021\\deng_et_al_2021_measuring_total_uncertainty_in_evidence_theory.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1791/deng_et_al_2021_measuring_total_uncertainty_in_evidence_theory.pdf"},{"key":"U8M62DCI","version":6641,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.22358","accessDate":"2023-05-18T01:37:23Z","parentItem":"UACH5VDT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"int.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:37:23Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:37:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/U8M62DCI","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\U8M62DCI\\int.html","defaultPath":"files/1789/int.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684373862796,"version":0},"$loki":1220},{"itemID":1792,"item":{"key":"UUAJ9IGA","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Required mathematical properties and behaviors of uncertainty measures on belief intervals","date":"2021","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","callNumber":"8.9924","extra":"Citation Key: moral2021required\nPublisher: Wiley Online Library","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"36","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","issue":"8","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Serafín","lastName":"Moral-García","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:38:59Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:39:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UUAJ9IGA","itemID":1792,"attachments":[],"notes":[{"key":"FTDUS9RN","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"UUAJ9IGA","note":"<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><pre><span style=\"color: rgb(232, 230, 227)\">@article{moral2021required,\n &nbsp;title={Required mathematical properties and behaviors of uncertainty measures on belief intervals},\n &nbsp;author={Moral-García, Seraf{\\'\\i}n and Abellán, Joaqu{\\'\\i}n},\n &nbsp;journal={International Journal of Intelligent Systems},\n &nbsp;volume={36},\n &nbsp;number={8},\n &nbsp;year={2021},\n &nbsp;publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}</span></pre>\n</div>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:39:03Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:39:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FTDUS9RN"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684373952574,"version":0},"$loki":1221},{"itemID":1794,"item":{"key":"X9KZNLY6","version":6658,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Measures of Entropy in the Theory of Evidence","abstractNote":"This paper considers two measures of entropy for the Theory of Evidence and studies their properties.

Several uncertainty measures in the theory of belief functions have been proposed. However, existing measures are generalizations of measures in the probabilistic framework. The inconsistency between different frameworks causes limitations to existing measures. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, a new total uncertainty measure is proposed directly in the framework of belief functions theory without changing the theoretical frameworks. The average distance between the belief interval of each singleton and the most uncertain case is used to represent the total uncertainty degree of the given body of evidence. Numerical examples, simulations, applications and related analyses are provided to verify the rationality of our new measure.","date":"2016-02-15","language":"en","archive":"Q1","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"8.1388","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705115004578","accessDate":"2023-05-18T01:36:01Z","extra":"Citation Key: yang2016new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"94","pages":"114-123","publicationTitle":"Knowledge-Based Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.knosys.2015.11.014","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Knowledge-Based Systems","ISSN":"0950-7051","creators":[{"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deqiang","lastName":"Han","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief functions","type":1},{"tag":"Belief interval","type":1},{"tag":"Distance of interval","type":1},{"tag":"Evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"Uncertainty measure","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:36:02Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:36:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZMM8TJJP","itemID":1784,"attachments":[{"key":"GUXXS674","version":6637,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705115004578","accessDate":"2023-05-18T01:36:23Z","parentItem":"ZMM8TJJP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0950705115004578.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:36:23Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:36:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GUXXS674","localPath":"E:\\VSCODE\\Markdown\\glossary\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\GUXXS674\\S0950705115004578.html","defaultPath":"files/1787/S0950705115004578.html"},{"key":"AGXPKHG7","version":6634,"itemType":"attachment","title":"yang_et_al_2016_a_new_distance-based_total_uncertainty_measure_in_the_theory_of_belief_functions.pdf","parentItem":"ZMM8TJJP","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:2016/yang_et_al_2016_a_new_distance-based_total_uncertainty_measure_in_the_theory_of_belief_functions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T01:36:13Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T01:36:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AGXPKHG7","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Zotero\\2016\\yang_et_al_2016_a_new_distance-based_total_uncertainty_measure_in_the_theory_of_belief_functions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1786/yang_et_al_2016_a_new_distance-based_total_uncertainty_measure_in_the_theory_of_belief_functions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684377374528,"version":0},"$loki":1227},{"itemID":1799,"item":{"key":"2G35ESHB","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"An introduction to probability theory and its applications, Volume 2","date":"1991","extra":"Citation Key: feller1991introduction","volume":"81","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","creators":[{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Feller","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-18T02:36:17Z","dateModified":"2023-05-18T02:36:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2G35ESHB","itemID":1799,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1684377382760,"version":0},"$loki":1228}],"idIndex":null,"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[68,76,99,91,104,179,71,97,77,171,113,177,110,108,121,164,166,86,101,165,176,116,115,112,120,117,123,106,107,109,111,122,119,96,90,94,95,79,100,83,162,73,89,93,98,75,17,92,9,66,14,21,27,6,43,8,39,38,15,31,1,60,0,46,45,47,33,10,52,36,12,13,74,88,114,85,84,102,22,181,81,82,80,118,70,78,72,87,163,58,56,44,54,161,19,69,103,50,32,30,167,48,169,51,23,11,2,55,62,18,26,4,57,41,61,16,42,24,37,25,29,132,134,28,137,140,5,53,7,142,143,59,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,3,63,65,64,67,40,34,20,35,105,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,133,135,136,138,139,49,141,173,174,175,168,172,170,178,180,182,183,184,185,186,192,187,188,189,190,191,193]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"Zotero":"6.0.26"}}]},"objType":"itemToExportFormat","dirty":false,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":1232,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[]}
