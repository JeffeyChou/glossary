It consists in a closed capillary channel folded into several meanders, evacuated, and partially filled with a liquid and its vapor. One side is in thermal contact with a hot spot, the other with a cold spot. The oscillation of the liquid plugs and vapor bubbles spontaneously occurs after the heating beginning. The heat exchange takes place not only by latent heat transfer, but also by liquid convection. Both this advantage and the PHP structural simplicity make it competitive with respect to other kinds of heat pipes. However, the PHP operation is non-stationary and depends on many physical and material parameters. As a result, application of empirical correlations is quite unsuccessful. More sophisticated direct modeling is thus required. In this review, we present the past, present, and future perspectives of the theoretical PHP studies. The physical phenomena on the level of a single bubble and single liquid plug is addressed first. In this context, the modeling of the simplest, single branch PHP is described as a necessary first step toward the PHP understanding and model validation. The modeling of interaction between the bubbles and plugs (bubble generation and disappearance, plug evaporation) is discussed next. Finally, the state of the art of the physical modeling and simulation of the multi-turn PHP is reviewed and the difference between existing approaches is explained.","date":"08/2021","language":"en","shortTitle":"Physical principles and state-of-the-art of modeling of the pulsating heat pipe","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359431121005512","accessDate":"2022-11-17T11:46:13Z","extra":"Citation Key: nikolayev2021physical","volume":"195","pages":"117111","publicationTitle":"Applied Thermal Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117111","journalAbbreviation":"Applied Thermal Engineering","ISSN":"13594311","creators":[{"firstName":"Vadim S.","lastName":"Nikolayev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ponyo's Heat Tube"},{"tag":"one branch php"}],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-17T11:46:13Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2FAL8KTK","itemID":495,"attachments":[{"key":"MAJLCWV8","version":6039,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Physical principles and state-of-the-art of modeling of the pulsating heat pipe.pdf","parentItem":"2FAL8KTK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Physical principles and state-of-the-art of modeling of the pulsating heat pipe.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

However, previous studies are mostly focused on training models with synthetic hazy images, which incurs performance drop when the models are used for real-world hazy images. We propose a Principled Synthetic-to-real Dehazing (PSD) framework to improve the generalization performance of dehazing. Starting from a dehazing model backbone that is pre-trained on synthetic data, PSD exploits real hazy images to ﬁne-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion. For the ﬁne-tuning, we leverage several well-grounded physical priors and combine them into a prior loss committee. PSD allows for most of the existing dehazing models as its backbone, and the combination of multiple physical priors boosts dehazing signiﬁcantly. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PSD framework establishes the new stateof-the-art performance for real-world dehazing, in terms of visual quality assessed by no-reference quality metrics as well as subjective evaluation and downstream task performance indicator.","date":"6/2021","language":"en","shortTitle":"PSD","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578422/","accessDate":"2023-03-30T08:04:17Z","extra":"Citation Key: chen2021psd","place":"Nashville, TN, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-66544-509-2","pages":"7176-7185","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00710","creators":[{"firstName":"Zeyuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yangchao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:17Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2FJSC4LB","itemID":1336,"attachments":[{"key":"SDBFI24B","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-PSD.pdf","parentItem":"2FJSC4LB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-PSD.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:07Z","dateModified":"2023-03-30T08:05:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/SDBFI24B","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\SDBFI24B\\2021-PSD.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1332/2021-PSD.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492920,"version":0},"$loki":1214},{"itemID":1642,"item":{"key":"2JX33K5M","version":5840,"itemType":"document","title":"US military buys location data of popular Muslim apps: Report","date":"November 17, 2020, 2020-12","language":"english","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/17/report-us-military-buying-location-data-on-popular-muslim-apps","accessDate":"2023-04-30","extra":"Citation Key: butler2017made\nISSN: 1672-3782\nPages: 1–2\nType: EB/OL\ntex.entrytype: digital","creators":[{"name":"JLJAZEERA","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-30T13:37:11Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T13:37:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2JX33K5M","itemID":1642,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492925,"version":0},"$loki":1215},{"itemID":24,"item":{"key":"2L7NULW5","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Belief function combination and conflict management","abstractNote":"Within the framework of evidence theory, data fusion consists in obtaining a single belief function by the combination of several belief functions resulting from distinct information sources. The most popular rule of combination, called Dempster’s rule of combination (or the orthogonal sum), has several interesting mathematical properties such as commutativity or associativity. However, combining belief functions with this operator implies normalizing the results by scaling them proportionally to the conﬂicting mass in order to keep some basic properties. Although this normalization seems logical, several authors have criticized it and some have proposed other solutions. In particular, Dempster’s combination operator is a poor solution for the management of the conﬂict between the various information sources at the normalization step. Conﬂict management is a major problem especially during the fusion of many information sources. Indeed, the conﬂict increases with the number of information sources. That is why a strategy for re-assigning the conﬂicting mass is essential. In this paper, we deﬁne a formalism to describe a family of combination operators. So, we propose to develop a generic framework in order to unify several classical rules of combination. We also propose other combination rules allowing an arbitrary or adapted assignment of the conﬂicting mass to subsets. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is one of the priorities in health. An increase in the number of the health services provided leads to an increase in the amount of HCW, which has particularly been noticeable in recent years. Since this is the waste that may pose a risk to humans and the environment, it is necessary to ensure an adequate treatment of the same. HCW management is particularly important in developing countries, due to inappropriate disposal methods, underfunding and a lack of the infrastructure. In order to achieve the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of this area, HCW should be minimized through an adequate treatment of the same. The Public Enterprise Zdravstvo Brčko (Brčko Health System) has intensively been addressing the HCW management issue. They have decided to upgrade the HCW system by purchasing a new infectious waste treatment facility. The paper is aimed at creating a new original integrated multicriteria decision-making model based on D numbers for processing fuzzy linguistic information. This model will serve to support management in the procurement of the mentioned facility. The model integrates the benefits of different approaches and theories. An initial model was formed, consisting of the six potential solutions evaluated based on the 18 criteria classified into the following four groups: social, environmental, economic and technological. Four experts in this field evaluated the criteria and potential solutions. Then, a new Best-Worst Method based on D numbers (BWM-D) was applied in order to determine the significance of the criteria. After that, a Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison Based on D numbers (MABAC-D) was developed and applied so as to evaluate and select an infectious waste treatment facility. The results have shown that the alternative A1 gives the best results, whereas the alternative A5 shows the worst results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the obtained results. In this part of the paper, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS-D) and VIšekriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisnog Rešenja (VIKOR-D) were developed in order to validate the results. When procuring a new Contagious Waste Treatment System, the characteristics of the available devices need be perceived and all the criteria need be taken into account in order to provide a device which will solve the HCW problem in the best way. This paper has shown how D numbers can be used when making a selection of an HCW management device, and also how all the characteristics of such a device can be perceived and how the device demonstrating the best characteristics can be selected.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421003031","extra":"Citation Key: pamucar2021new","volume":"175","pages":"114862","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114862","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamučar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adis","lastName":"Puška","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Željko","lastName":"Stević","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Ćirović","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BWM"},{"tag":"D numbers"},{"tag":"Fuzzy linguistic variable"},{"tag":"MABAC"},{"tag":"Waste management"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3II5P6BI","itemID":1443,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492966,"version":0},"$loki":1220},{"itemID":1323,"item":{"key":"3LPAF595","version":5508,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Human Voice Recognition Depends on Language Ability","abstractNote":"People with dyslexia have more difficulty than expected in recognizing familiar voices.\n          , \n            The ability to recognize people by their voice is an important social behavior.

Impaired phonological processing is characteristic of dyslexia and thought to be a basis for difficulty in learning to read. We tested voice-recognition abilities of dyslexic and control listeners for voices speaking listeners’ native language or an unfamiliar language. Individuals with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities compared with controls only for voices speaking their native language. These results demonstrate the importance of linguistic representations for voice recognition. Humans appear to identify voices by making comparisons between talkers’ pronunciations of words and listeners’ stored abstract representations of the sounds in those words.","date":"2011-07-29","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"综合性期刊1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"综合性期刊1区","callNumber":"63.8321","url":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1207327","accessDate":"2023-03-30T00:36:27Z","rights":"59.9234","extra":"Citation Key: perrachione2011human","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"333","pages":"595-595","publicationTitle":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1207327","issue":"6042","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Science","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","creators":[{"firstName":"Tyler K.","lastName":"Perrachione","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephanie N.","lastName":"Del Tufo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John D.

The tested CLOHPs are all made from copper capillary tubes with inner diameters (IDs) of 1.2, 2, and 2.4 mm. Two working ﬂuids, pure water and ethanol, were used with ﬁlling ratios of 40%, 50%, and 60% by volume. The evaporator of each CLOHP was electrically heated with alterable lengths, while the condenser was liquid cooled with a constant length. Experimental results show that the thermal performance of the CLOHPs depends on the conjugation effects of working ﬂuid, ﬁlling ratio, inner diameter, evaporator length, and heating power input. The 2 mm ID and 2.4 mm ID CLOHPs had better thermal performance when charged with water as compared with ethanol, while ethanol was preferred for the 1.2 mm ID CLOHP. The thermal performance of these CLOHPs was enhanced at the relatively lower ﬁlling ratios (40% and 50%). An optimum evaporator length corresponding to the lowest thermal resistance was proved. Finally, an empirical correlation based on 510 sets of available experimental data both from the present study and other literatures was proposed to predict the thermal performance of vertical CLOHPs. The proposed correlation agreed with the experimental data within a deviation of approximately ±40%.","date":"12/2013","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"11.4454","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306261913001384","accessDate":"2022-12-07T02:17:24Z","rights":"11.268","extra":"Citation Key: qu2013experimental","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"112","pages":"1154-1160","publicationTitle":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.02.030","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Energ","ISSN":"03062619","creators":[{"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Qu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T02:17:24Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3MM2DGVN","itemID":633,"attachments":[{"key":"WHPUKGJW","version":6038,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2013-Experimental study on the thermal performance of vertical closed-loop.pdf","parentItem":"3MM2DGVN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2013-Experimental study on the thermal performance of vertical closed-loop.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/2\">2 Description of the experiment</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/2\">2.1 Experimental setup</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/3\">2.2 Data reduction and uncertainty analysis</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/3\">3 Results and discussion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/3\">3.1 Thermal performance of the CLOHPs</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:24px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/3\">3.1.1 Effect of filling ratio and working fluid</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/4\">3.1.2 Effect of inner diameter</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/4\">3.1.3 Effect of evaporator length</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/5\">3.2 Correlation prediction of thermal performance</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/6\">4 Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/7\">Acknowledgments</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_6GVKYD8A/7\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T05:40:58Z","dateModified":"2022-12-07T05:40:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/WHPUKGJW","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\WHPUKGJW\\2013-Experimental study on the thermal performance of vertical closed-loop.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1111/2013-Experimental study on the thermal performance of vertical closed-loop.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492981,"version":0},"$loki":1222},{"itemID":1442,"item":{"key":"3QWSAKS2","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Estimation of the qualification and behavior of a contributor and aggregation of his answers in a crowdsourcing context","abstractNote":"Crowdsourcing is the outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of contributors on a dedicated platform. The crowd on these platforms is very diversified and includes various profiles of contributors which generates data of uneven quality. However, majority voting, which is the aggregating method commonly used in platforms, gives equal weight to each contribution. To overcome this problem, we propose a method, MONITOR, which estimates the contributor’s profile and aggregates the collected data by taking into account their possible imperfections thanks to the theory of belief functions. To do so, MONITOR starts by estimating the profile of the contributor through his qualification for the task and his behavior. Crowdsourcing campaigns have been carried out to collect the necessary data to test MONITOR on real data in order to compare it to existing approaches. The results of the experiments show that thanks to the use of the MONITOR method, we obtain a better rate of correct answer after aggregation of the contributions compared to the majority voting. Our contributions in this article are for the first time the proposal of a model that takes into account both the qualification of the contributor and his behavior in the estimation of his profile. For the second one, the weakening and the aggregation of the answers according to the estimated profiles.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422025155","extra":"Citation Key: thierry2023estimation","volume":"216","pages":"119496","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119496","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Constance","lastName":"Thierry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Martin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean-Christophe","lastName":"Dubois","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yolande","lastName":"Le Gall","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Uncertainty"},{"tag":"Belief functions"},{"tag":"Crowdsourcing"},{"tag":"Imprecision"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3QWSAKS2","itemID":1442,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492987,"version":0},"$loki":1223},{"itemID":1439,"item":{"key":"3WHUXS2J","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evidential link prediction by exploiting the applicability of similarity indexes to nodes","abstractNote":"Owning to its extensive range of applications, the study of link prediction has captured considerable attention from researchers. Recently, hybrid similarity methods, which incorporate multiple sources of information, have been reported to perform link prediction. However, the applicability of a similarity method to different nodes has not been exploited in the previous hybrid methods. In this regard, we propose a new hybrid algorithm that fuses the results of multiple similarity indexes via the evidence theory. In the proposed algorithm, each similarity index is considered as a source of evidence and the corresponding basic belief assignment (BBA) is derived from the similarity score. More importantly, to adaptively estimate the reliability of evidence, the applicable coefficient (AC) of an index to a node is computed. Then, the BBA of a node pair with respect to a similarity index is discounted according to the ACs of the index to two endpoints. The connection probability of the node pair is gauged by fusing multiple discounted BBAs. Experimental results based on several real-world networks suggest that the proposed method is superior to individual similarity indexes and baseline methods.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422015068","extra":"Citation Key: fang2022evidential","volume":"210","pages":"118397","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118397","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shiyu","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Longjie","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Binyan","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Evidence theory"},{"tag":"Complex networks"},{"tag":"Hybrid method"},{"tag":"Link prediction"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3WHUXS2J","itemID":1439,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117492992,"version":0},"$loki":1224},{"itemID":689,"item":{"key":"3XWZVRTB","version":5501,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A model of stable functioning of the single branch pulsating heat pipe","abstractNote":"A simpliﬁed model nonlinear describing the stable functioning of the single branch PHP is proposed.

A lot of attention is paid to situations when in the solution of decision making problem the competing fuzzy classes with intersecting membership functions in antecedent parts of fuzzy rules, e.g., such as Low and Moderate play an important role in the problem formulation. As a result, a new mathematical object “belief interval bounded belief interval” (BIBBI) is obtained. The properties of BIBBI make it possible to use it as a more reliable representation of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value than that formulated in terms of A-IFS. Using the introduced DST based definition of interval-valued A-IFS, the corresponding operations with BIBBIs and the DST representation of rule base evidential reasoning in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting, a new approach to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy extension of rule base evidential reasoning is developed. To prove the correctness and applicability of this approach to the solution of decision making problems, a case study of its use for the type 2 diabetes diagnostics is analyzed.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742200505X","extra":"Citation Key: dymova2022extension","volume":"201","pages":"117100","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117100","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Ludmila","lastName":"Dymova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kaczmarek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Sevastjanov","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence"},{"tag":"Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy extension"},{"tag":"Rule base evidential reasoning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/42TZLP47","itemID":1452,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493045,"version":0},"$loki":1227},{"itemID":1239,"item":{"key":"43N7ZIX7","version":5506,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An  N -soft set approach to rough sets","date":"2019","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能1区  工程：电子与电气1区","extra":"Publisher: IEEE\nCitation Key: alcantud2019soft","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"28","pages":"2996–3007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issue":"11","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Jose Carlos R","lastName":"Alcantud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Feng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald R","lastName":"Yager","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T04:03:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/43N7ZIX7","itemID":1239,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493050,"version":0},"$loki":1228},{"itemID":1491,"item":{"key":"47YXMPME","version":6051,"itemType":"attachment","title":"浅谈移动互联网时代企业市场营销策略的转型_张连起.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"浅谈移动互联网时代企业市场营销策略的转型_张连起.pdf","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T12:54:34Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T12:54:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/47YXMPME","itemID":1491,"localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\47YXMPME\\浅谈移动互联网时代企业市场营销策略的转型_张连起.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1491/浅谈移动互联网时代企业市场营销策略的转型_张连起.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493055,"version":0},"$loki":1229},{"itemID":1008,"item":{"key":"499P5SU6","version":5503,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Rank-One Prior: Toward Real-Time Scene Recovery","abstractNote":"Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task for several practical applications, e.g., video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. To improve visual quality under different weather/imaging conditions, we propose a real-time light correction method to recover the degraded scenes in the cases of sandstorms, underwater, and haze.

However, the rapid growth of scientific publications and digital data makes identifying the right experts a challenging problem. Existing approaches for finding experts given a topic can be categorised into information retrieval techniques such as vector space models, document language models, and graph-based models. In this paper, we propose ExpFinder , a new hybrid model for expert finding, that integrates a novel N-gram vector space model, denoted as nVSM, and a graph-based model, denoted as μCO-HITS, that is a proposed variation of the CO-HITS algorithm. The key of nVSM is to exploit recent inverse document frequency weighting method for N-gram words, and ExpFinder incorporates nVSM into μCO-HITS to achieve expert finding. We comprehensively evaluate ExpFinder on four different datasets from the academic domains in comparison with six different expert finding models. The evaluation results show that ExpFinder is an highly effective model for expert finding, substantially outperforming all the compared models in 19% to 160.2%.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422017237","extra":"Citation Key: kang2023expfinder","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"211","pages":"118691","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118691","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yong-Bin","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Du","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdur Rahim Mohammad","lastName":"Forkan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prem Prakash","lastName":"Jayaraman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Aryani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timos","lastName":"Sellis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bipartite graph"},{"tag":"Co-hits"},{"tag":"Expert collaboration graph"},{"tag":"Expert finding"},{"tag":"ExpFinder"},{"tag":"Text-based expertise"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4CZF6L3R","itemID":1414,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493073,"version":0},"$loki":1232},{"itemID":1558,"item":{"key":"4D5CHRN4","version":5590,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Targeting and Privacy in Mobile Advertising","abstractNote":"Mobile in-app advertising is now the dominant form of digital advertising. Although these ads have excellent user-tracking properties, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a uniﬁed modeling framework that consists of two components—a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under counterfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We ﬁnd that an efﬁcient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80% over the current system. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information compared with contextual information. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that although total surplus grows with more granular targeting, the ad network’s revenues are nonmonotonic; that is, the most efﬁcient targeting does not maximize ad network revenues. Rather, it is maximized when the ad network does not allow advertisers to engage in behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that ad networks may have economic incentives to preserve users’ privacy without external regulation.","date":"03/2021","language":"en","archive":"Q2","url":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1235","accessDate":"2023-04-29T14:21:06Z","extra":"Citation Key: rafieian2021targeting","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"40","pages":"193-218","publicationTitle":"Marketing Science","DOI":"10.1287/mksc.2020.1235","issue":"2","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Marketing Science","ISSN":"0732-2399, 1526-548X","creators":[{"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Rafieian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hema","lastName":"Yoganarasimhan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T14:21:06Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T14:21:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4D5CHRN4","itemID":1558,"attachments":[{"key":"SHNIFKYQ","version":6052,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Targeting and Privacy in Mobile Advertising.pdf","parentItem":"4D5CHRN4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Targeting and Privacy in Mobile Advertising.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T14:20:57Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T14:22:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/SHNIFKYQ","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\SHNIFKYQ\\2021-Targeting and Privacy in Mobile Advertising.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1557/2021-Targeting and Privacy in Mobile Advertising.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493082,"version":0},"$loki":1233},{"itemID":1462,"item":{"key":"4FH2AV7U","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved sparse representation based robust hybrid feature extraction models with transfer and deep learning for EEG classification","abstractNote":"Numerous studies in the field of cognitive research is dependent on Electroencephalography (EEG) as it apprehends the neural correspondences of various mental activities such as memory, speech, or attention related activities with millisecond precision. In this work, initially sparse rendition is imposed on EEG signals and then sparse optimization is performed to it. For sparse representation, initially the work utilized both K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) for dictionary learning along with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for sparse coding. Later an advanced OMP technique was developed which made a significant improvement, and then instead of K-SVD, K-means and Method of Optimal direction (MOD) techniques were utilized with it and as a result, totally six different combinations in sparse representation optimization were developed. Then, it is modelled into clusters using seven different hybrid models developed here for the purpose of feature extraction and selection. Out of the seven models, two models are already existing such as Finite Mixture Logistic Regression Model (FMLR) and Expectation-Maximization based Gaussian Mixture Model (EM-GMM) which are widely used. The remaining five hybrid models are proposed as variations of GMM such as Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization (VBMF) based GMM (VBMF-GMM), VBMF and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with GMM (VBMF-PCA-GMM), VBMF and Partial Least Squares (PLS) with GMM (VBMF-PLS-GMM), VBMF and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) with GMM (VBMF-CCA-GMM) and Empirical VBMF with GMM (EVBMF-GMM). This model is validated on two unique EEG datasets, such as epilepsy dataset and schizophrenia dataset, and the results have been classified with the standard machine learning techniques, transfer learning techniques and the proposed deep learning techniques leading to a total of twelve different classifiers and a comprehensive analysis is made in this work with very promising results in terms of classification accuracy reporting more than 95% for most of the proposed cases.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422002421","extra":"Citation Key: prabhakar2022improved","volume":"198","pages":"116783","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116783","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sunil Kumar","lastName":"Prabhakar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Seong-Whan","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Deep learning"},{"tag":"EEG"},{"tag":"Hybrid feature extraction"},{"tag":"Sparse representation"},{"tag":"Transfer learning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4FH2AV7U","itemID":1462,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493086,"version":0},"$loki":1234},{"itemID":1316,"item":{"key":"4SA8788T","version":5508,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme for Single Haze Images Using Color Constancy Prior","abstractNote":"Hazy environment attenuates the scene radiance and causes difﬁculty in distinguishing the color and texture of the scene.

The prior utilizes the statistical observation that distant scenery objects become the most haze-opaque due to the pixel escalation towards the higher intensity side. The comparative evaluation on a variety of haze images manifests that the proposed prior perform better than existing air-light recovery methods and can be used for subsequent dehazing applications.","date":"2020","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"工程：电子与电气3区","callNumber":"3.2012","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201388/","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:28:46Z","rights":"3.7347","extra":"Citation Key: gautam2020improved","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"27","pages":"1695-1699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LSP.2020.3025462","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Ieee Signal Proc Let","ISSN":"1070-9908, 1558-2361","creators":[{"firstName":"Sidharth","lastName":"Gautam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tapan Kumar","lastName":"Gandhi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B.K.","lastName":"Panigrahi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"雾线估计"},{"tag":"air-light vector"},{"tag":"color constancy prior"},{"tag":"dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:28:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4SA8788T","itemID":1316,"attachments":[{"key":"UY8Q52MP","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gautam 等 - 2020 - An Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme for Single.pdf","parentItem":"4SA8788T","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gautam 等 - 2020 - An Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme for Single.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:28:40Z","dateModified":"2023-03-29T05:28:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UY8Q52MP","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\UY8Q52MP\\Gautam 等 - 2020 - An Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme for Single.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1315/Gautam 等 - 2020 - An Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme for Single.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"B2WWRJJK","version":4831,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"4SA8788T","note":"<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/sidharthscorpio/color-constancy-prior\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://github.com/sidharthscorpio/color-constancy-prior</a></p>\n<p>对应的开源代码</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:29:36Z","dateModified":"2023-03-29T05:29:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/B2WWRJJK"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493099,"version":0},"$loki":1235},{"itemID":1223,"item":{"key":"4WHWJL45","version":5504,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Uncertainty measure in evidence theory with its applications","date":"2018","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能3区","callNumber":"5.0187","rights":"4.7603","extra":"Publisher: Springer\nCitation Key: wang2018uncertainty","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"48","pages":"1672–1688","publicationTitle":"Applied Intelligence","issue":"7","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Intell","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:37:51Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4WHWJL45","itemID":1223,"attachments":[{"key":"N2R9NY9V","version":6055,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2018-Uncertainty measure in evidence theory with its applications.pdf","parentItem":"4WHWJL45","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2018-Uncertainty measure in evidence theory with its applications.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

The degraded image has some problems, such as color distortion, low-visibility, fuzz and non-uniform luminance, due to the light is absorbed and scattered by particles in sandstorm. The proposed approach based on fusion principles aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations. First, the degraded image is color corrected by adopting a statistical strategy. Then two inputs, which represent different brightness, are derived only from the color corrected image by applying Gamma correction. Three weighted maps (sharpness, chromaticity and prominence), which contain important features to increase the quality of the degraded image, are computed from the derived inputs. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by fusing the inputs with the weight maps. The proposed method is the ﬁrst to adopt a fusion-based method for enhancing single sandstorm image. Experimental results show that enhanced results can be improved by color correction, well enhanced details and local contrast while promoted global brightness, increasing the visibility, naturalness preservation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is mostly calculated by per-pixel operation, which is appropriate for real-time applications.","date":"9/2014","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6958791/","accessDate":"2023-03-28T09:27:03Z","extra":"Citation Key: fu2014fusionbased","place":"Jakarta, Indonesia","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-4799-5896-2","pages":"1-5","proceedingsTitle":"2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","conferenceName":"2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","DOI":"10.1109/MMSP.2014.6958791","creators":[{"firstName":"Xueyang","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Delu","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiao-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinghao","lastName":"Ding","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"image enhancement"},{"tag":"fusion-based method"},{"tag":"sandstorm"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T09:27:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5ARQCPFZ","itemID":1312,"attachments":[{"key":"R37B6E38","version":6028,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fu 等 - 2014 - A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sands.pdf","url":"https://xueyangfu.github.io/paper/2014/MMSP/MMSP2014.pdf","accessDate":"2023-03-28T09:26:54Z","parentItem":"5ARQCPFZ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fu 等 - 2014 - A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sands.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T09:26:54Z","dateModified":"2023-03-28T09:27:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/R37B6E38","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\R37B6E38\\Fu 等 - 2014 - A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sands.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1311/Fu 等 - 2014 - A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sands.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493126,"version":0},"$loki":1237},{"itemID":410,"item":{"key":"5ESLBEBS","version":5496,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"On the Evaluation of Data Fusion for Information Retrieval","abstractNote":"Data Fusion combines document rankings from multiple systems into one, in order to improve retrieval effectiveness.

In this paper, a fast color balance method followed by an effective fusion model is proposed to enhance the sandstorm-degraded images. Firstly, color channel compensation and piece-wise afﬁne transform balance the aberrant pixels obtained by camera and remove color cast. Then, multi-path fusion comprising of underexposure and contrast-enhanced inputs is used for visibility enhancement, where saturation and Laplacian contrast are measured as weight maps and constructed for Gaussian pyramids. In order to reduce block effects and artifacts of the reconstructed image, we introduce the multi-scale strategy for each path. Experimental results of both synthetic and real-world sandstorm images demonstrate that the proposed color balance method features high computational efﬁciency and performs much better than comparative methods in terms of image quality. In addition, our fusion-based method also outperforms existing enhancement algorithms of sandstorm image via qualitative and quantitative evaluations.","date":"04/2021","language":"en","archive":"Q4","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"工程：电子与电气4区  成像科学与照相技术4区","callNumber":"1.5828","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-020-01786-1","accessDate":"2023-03-28T15:05:56Z","rights":"1.5300","extra":"Citation Key: wang2021fast","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"637-644","publicationTitle":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","DOI":"10.1007/s11760-020-01786-1","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Signal Image Video P","ISSN":"1863-1703, 1863-1711","creators":[{"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Wei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zitong","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chongyi","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"fusion-based method"},{"tag":"color balance"},{"tag":"sandstorm images"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T15:05:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5EX8Q5NI","itemID":1314,"attachments":[{"key":"MC4J3R78","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Fast color balance and multi-path fusion for sandstorm image enhancement.pdf","parentItem":"5EX8Q5NI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Fast color balance and multi-path fusion for sandstorm image enhancement.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-28T15:05:50Z","dateModified":"2023-03-28T15:05:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/MC4J3R78","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\MC4J3R78\\2021-Fast color balance and multi-path fusion for sandstorm image enhancement.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1313/2021-Fast color balance and multi-path fusion for sandstorm image enhancement.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493189,"version":0},"$loki":1239},{"itemID":175,"item":{"key":"5NHS2PRW","version":5493,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Viewing cute images increases behavioral carefulness.","abstractNote":"Infantile physical morphology—marked by its “cuteness”—is thought to be a potent elicitor of caregiving, yet little is known about how cuteness may shape immediate behavior.

In 2 experiments, viewing very cute images (puppies and kittens)—as opposed to slightly cute images (dogs and cats)—led to superior performance on a subsequent fine-motor dexterity task (the children’s game “Operation”).

本文采用规范研究方法和实证研究方法。首先对古今中外关于道德、商业道德、营销道德的概念及营销道德的测评文献进行回顾和比较,并在此基础上,针对垄断企业经营特点和现实及反垄断法关于垄断经营行为的内容,提出并分析了垄断企业营销道德评价指标和维度。其次,采用因子分析方法开发了垄断企业营销道德感知量表,并通过实证的形式验证了量表的有效性；再次,在文献回顾的理论基础上,提出了垄断企业营销道德与关系质量的结构方程模型和假设,选择银行企业、移动通信企业的消费者作为调查对象,对模型和假设进行了检验,并对两个行业的数据开展了比较分析。最后,在研究结论的基础上提出了垄断企业合理性经营与营销道德建设的对策及建议。 通过研究分析,本文得到主要结论如下： （1）营销道德的概念与商业道德概念存在相似之处,其核心判断标准均来自商业伦理标准,只是商业道德的概念更为宽泛,比较抽象；营销道德的概念更为具体,其内容针对企业经营行为。道德不是天生的,无论从经济学角度还是法律角度来看,垄断并不直接意味着不道德,其只是产生非道德营销行为的体制原因,但并不是决定性原因,而只有经营行为不道德时,企业才是不道德的企业。垄断企业表现为不道德,是指其利用信息不对称和市场支配地位实施不道德的营销行为。 （2）近年来,垄断企业频繁发生非道德行为主要表现为经营不诚信、价格不公道、交易不公平、履行社会责不积极,具体行为是：信息不透明或不真实、店大欺客、不兑现承诺、价格信息不公开、入门费和两部制定价、双边定价、搭售、价格合谋、歧视价格、格式合同、同工不同酬、不注重环保、不积极承担与其地位相称的社会责任等。通过探索性研究和因子分析,消费者对垄断企业营销道德指标的感知归为诚信经营因子、价格公平与公正因子、公平竞争与公平交易因子、社会责任因子等四个因子。 （3）本文实证研究发现,营销道德中诚信经营、价格公平与公正、公平交易与公平竞争对消费者的满意度、信任度、承诺均存在显著影响；社会责任对于垄断企业的关系质量的影响不显著。消费者对企业垄断感知越强,社会责任的影响越不明显,这说明消费者从自身出发,诚信经营、价格公平与公正、公平交易与公平竞争是保健因素,社会责任更像激励因素。 （4）实证研究发现,营销道德各维度对关系质量各维度的影响存在差异。垄断程度感知具有调节作用和扩大的负效应,即由于消费者对垄断认知的消极情绪的存在,会降低对企业道德水平的判断。垄断作为一种诱发企业非道德行为的体制因素,消费者往往会对垄断企业有更苛刻的道德判断。通过对比两组样本数据及分析发现,消费者认为移动通信企业的垄断性要强于银行企业,而且这种感知影响其对于营销道德的判断。在两行业中,对于企业垄断性、经营行为垄断性、员工垄断意识三个方面,消费者的垄断感知程度依次减弱,这说明垄断企业可以在后两个方面做出努力,来降低整体垄断感知的强度。","date":"2013","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=21&FileName=1014395781.nh&DbName=CDFDLAST2015&DbCode=CDFD","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:48Z","extra":"Citation

affect heuristic using fuzzy rules and Taguchi statistical method for tuning complex systems","abstractNote":"Affect heuristic is a subjective feeling that enables human's quick and efficient decision-making in unstructured and uncertain environments. It is an experience-based subconscious process in which information is framed for quick interpretation. Here, we propose a hybrid Experiment-based Decision-making architecture based on Affect Heuristics (EDAH) that uses possibility and probability theories in combination utilizing fuzzy logic's ability to address deterministic uncertainty and graduality of truth, along with Taguchi method's ability to exploit the statistical data as a robust and suboptimal experiment design methodology. Accordingly, the proposed paradigm aims to make the best decision from a set of feasible decisions using fewer experiments by inserting reliable subjective information by the expert in the random samples of experiments. The proposed method is mathematically defined and then applied to the problem of Targeted Drug Delivery (TDD) for cancer treatment in the two states of with and without noise. Furthermore, we study the effect of three membership functions, consisting of triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian forms on our decisions' selection for making an improved medical decision and avoiding an unprofitable one by recognizing existing opportunities. Results indicate considerable improvement of normoxic and hypoxic cell densities when compared with the competing approaches.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421000798","extra":"Citation Key: radyraz2021experimentbased","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"172","pages":"114638","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114638","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Nasibeh","lastName":"Rady Raz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad-R.","lastName":"Akbarzadeh-T.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Akbarzadeh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Affect heuristics"},{"tag":"Cognitive models"},{"tag":"Parameter learning"},{"tag":"Taguchi method"},{"tag":"Targeted drug delivery"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5Y6VSQSP","itemID":1428,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493214,"version":0},"$loki":1243},{"itemID":1011,"item":{"key":"5YLKH4EX","version":5503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Single image dehazing based on bright channel prior model and saliency analysis strategy","abstractNote":"Haze is a common atmospheric phenomenon that causes poor visibility in outdoor images, which greatly limits image application in later stages. Therefore, haze removal has become the ﬁrst and most indispensable step when dealing with degraded images. In this paper, we propose a novel bright channel prior (BCP) model and a saliency analysis strategy for haze removal. First, we obtain a more robust and accurate atmospheric light by a superpixelbased dark channel method. Second, we utilize the dark channel prior (DCP) to handle dark regions in hazy images. However, the DCP often mistakes white regions for opaque haze and thus causes serious colour distortion and halo effects. To solve this problem, a new BCP is proposed to accurately estimate the transmission of bright regions in hazy images. Third, we fuse the DCP and BCP using a multiscale fusion strategy with Laplacian pyramid representation to gain the correct transmission information for both bright and dark regions. Finally, a novel saliency analysis strategy for transmission reﬁnement is proposed, so that the texture details can remain present to the greatest extent in the restored images. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed method performs well in restoring images containing bright objects.","date":"04/2021","language":"en","archive":"Q3/Q4","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"1.7729","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ipr2.12082","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:30:03Z","rights":"1.9592","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2021single","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"1023-1031","publicationTitle":"IET Image Processing","DOI":"10.1049/ipr2.12082","issue":"5","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Iet Image Process","ISSN":"1751-9659, 1751-9667","creators":[{"firstName":"Libao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaohan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"haze removal"},{"tag":"bright channel prior"},{"tag":"image restoration"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:30:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5YLKH4EX","itemID":1011,"attachments":[{"key":"HQAZH7AV","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Single image dehazing based on bright channel prior model and saliency analysis.pdf","parentItem":"5YLKH4EX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Single image dehazing based on bright channel prior model and saliency analysis.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Based on our review, we found that in these methods’ prior information about the data such as grades of membership during the computation is required and these methods are also incompatible with the parameterization tools. To address this issue, we proposed an approach for ranking the functional requirements of software using fuzzy-soft set theory. The relative deviation between counts of non-functional requirements has been used to construct the fuzzy-soft sets. The weights of the non-functional requirements and the ranking order of the functional requirements are computed from fuzzy soft-set derived from raw data in which no prior information about data is required.

To address few fault cases and deficient monitoring information in diagnostic tasks, this paper provides an improved few-shot learning method based on approximation space and belief functions to accomplish fault diagnosis of transformers. The decision-making table, as an efficient structure to map the weakly correlated attributes, is extracted from transformer cases and maintenance experience. Then the approximation space is used to describe attribute correlations between diagnostic rules and the diagnostic task. We employ the 0.5-approximation set strategy to obtain the diagnostic results when the information is sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a modified basic probability assignment (BPA) calculation method to build belief functions for diagnosis when information is scanty. The modified method is verified capable of improving the decision-making reliability. The overall recognition accuracy of fault diagnosis by our improved few-shot learning algorithm is over 87% which is higher than other four peer methods. This method also shows a potential for good expandability when new diagnostic rules of transformers are discovered.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420308587","extra":"Citation Key: xu2021improved","volume":"167","pages":"114105","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114105","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yaoyu","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yijing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dexing","lastName":"Zhong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guanjun","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Evidence theory"},{"tag":"Belief functions"},{"tag":"Approximation space"},{"tag":"Few-shot learning"},{"tag":"Rough set"},{"tag":"Transformer fault diagnosis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:52:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6FJZVKHH","itemID":1463,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493259,"version":0},"$loki":1250},{"itemID":949,"item":{"key":"6ML5334B","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:11:34Z","dateModified":"2023-03-15T07:11:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6ML5334B","itemID":949,"localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\6ML5334B\\9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf","defaultPath":"files/949/9-1 广义证据理论及应用（1）：基本理论.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493262,"version":0},"$loki":1251},{"itemID":1505,"item":{"key":"6RQMNTUE","version":5676,"itemType":"thesis","title":"企业产品营销道德评价研究","abstractNote":"随着我国市场经济的不断发展，企业为社会及广大消费者提供了日益丰富的产品，提高了人民的生活水平，为社会做出了巨大贡献。同时，市场竞争的不断加剧以及优胜劣汰的竞争规律使得一些企业采用违背法律和营销道德的手段去争取顾客和获取最大利益，比如生产和销售假冒伪劣产品，诱使消费者购买不需要的产品，制作和宣传虚假广告，夸大产品功能等。这些违背法律和道德的营销行为，不仅破坏了公平竞争原则，损害了广大消费者和社会的利益，也影响企业自身的信誉和形象，不利于企业的长期发展。营销道德是伴随着市场经济而产生的，市场经济及市场营销活动的存在，必然要求市场营销活动受营销道德的约束。 本文在分析营销道德研究的必要性、国内外研究现状、国内外研究成果和存在的问题，以及营销道德评价的基础上，对企业产品营销道德的评价进行了初步探讨。首先在分析企业非道德营销行为的基础上，根据指标体系的设计原则，建立了企业营销道德综合评价指标体系和评价模式，并将企业产品中的非道德营销行为划分为质量、安全、服务、包装和环境污染五个方面。其次是根据我国企业现实中存在的问题，对企业产品五个方面的非道德营销行为进行了详尽的分析，并对每个方面都设定了两、三个道德性因素指标，对每个指标都进行了评价和定量化处理，建立了产品质量、安全、服务、包装和环境污染的评价指标体系和评价模式，最后还进行了应用分析。","date":"2004","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=6&FileName=2005012902.nh&DbName=CMFD0506&DbCode=CMFD","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:21:55Z","extra":"Citation Key: liu2004qi","thesisType":"硕士","university":"西南石油学院","creators":[{"name":"刘远飞","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"评价模式","type":1},{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"指标体系","type":1},{"tag":"产品","type":1},{"tag":"evaluation mode","type":1},{"tag":"index system","type":1},{"tag":"marketing ethics","type":1},{"tag":"product","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:21:55Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6RQMNTUE","itemID":1505,"attachments":[{"key":"FGV9P8PG","version":6054,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2004-企业产品营销道德评价研究.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJFo8d3crjALHLDOld0RphO1z3kZXPkD9K85pgfmCsc%2bBRsbAoyvB4t8pFeksLzfjVn8rfsx7oVS10lgvb%2f1ppsSFQfYb%2fsWxjDp1dyyvnXifwo8N81fEwA%2bMIihW25E%2b1uHjmsLR9kxNYqbgGCJRC%2b8McM%2fMH9KwMvEwiwuTaU9cdhJ7U5LVtaXB8JU2f881KibDEsVTzn10cHLOJQAxCdCahtTKgx5TffX%2fUETXdZwN","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:01Z","parentItem":"6RQMNTUE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2004-企业产品营销道德评价研究.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

However, there are few methods that can meet its universal and efficient characteristics. This paper proposes a new multi-classification assessment model of personal credit risk based on the theory of information fusion (MIFCA) by using six machine learning algorithms. The MIFCA model can simultaneously integrate the advantages of multiple classifiers and reduce the interference of uncertain information. In order to verify the MIFCA model, dataset collected from a real data set of commercial bank in China. Experimental results show that MIFCA model has two outstanding points in various assessment criteria. One is that it has higher accuracy for multi-classification assessment, and the other is that it is suitable for various risk assessments and has universal applicability. In addition, the results of this research can also provide references for banks and other financial institutions to strengthen their risk prevention and control capabilities, improve their credit risk identification capabilities, and avoid financial losses.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421015475","extra":"Citation Key: wang2022multiclassification","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"191","pages":"116236","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116236","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Tianhui","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renjing","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Qi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"D-S evidence theory"},{"tag":"Information fusion"},{"tag":"Multi-classification assessment"},{"tag":"Personal credit risk"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/73KKLXJ8","itemID":1433,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493393,"version":0},"$loki":1256},{"itemID":1260,"item":{"key":"78VJI48F","version":5507,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of belief functions","date":"2019","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能2区","callNumber":"8.9924","rights":"8.9264","extra":"Publisher: Wiley Online Library\nCitation Key: jiang2019new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"34","pages":"1337–1347","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Intell Syst","creators":[{"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-26T10:05:54Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/78VJI48F","itemID":1260,"attachments":[{"key":"WRT8W3XS","version":6055,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2019-A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of.pdf","parentItem":"78VJI48F","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2019-A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-15T13:39:09Z","dateModified":"2023-04-15T13:39:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/WRT8W3XS","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\WRT8W3XS\\2019-A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1375/2019-A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493398,"version":0},"$loki":1257},{"itemID":403,"item":{"key":"7AKXQMDN","version":5496,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sand deformation under proportional loading","abstractNote":"A fundamentalexperimentalstudy of sand behaviour under low stressratio proportional loading wherein all strain components are contractant is presented.

The DST is based on the concept of a basic probability assignment. An important part of this theory is the quantification of the information-based-uncertainty that this function represents. A recent measure of uncertainty (or information) in this theory, called the Deng entropy, has appeared as an interesting alternative to the measures presented so far. This measure quantifies the both types of uncertainty found in DST, then it is considered as a total uncertainty measure (TU). It is shown that this measure does not verify some of the essential properties for a TU in DST such as monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity. Also, the definition of this new measure produces other debatable situations. These shortcomings call in question the utility of this measure in applications.","date":"2017-02-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077916303836","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:12:11Z","extra":"Citation Key: abellan2017analyzing","volume":"95","pages":"195-199","publicationTitle":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"10.1016/j.chaos.2016.12.024","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","ISSN":"0960-0779","creators":[{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Deng entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Discord","type":1},{"tag":"Imprecise probabilities","type":1},{"tag":"Measures of uncertainty","type":1},{"tag":"Non-specificity","type":1},{"tag":"Theory of evidence","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:12:11Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7MCUFCJK","itemID":349,"attachments":[{"key":"HKVHA646","version":1207,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Abellan2017.md","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Abellan2017.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T03:34:02Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T03:34:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/HKVHA646","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Abellan2017.md","defaultPath":"files/444/@Abellan2017.md"},{"key":"3FWEE25C","version":6046,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Abellan2017.md","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Abellan2017.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:46:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:46:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/3FWEE25C","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\3FWEE25C\\@Abellan2017.md","defaultPath":"files/1202/@Abellan2017.md"},{"key":"ZDS8X5DF","version":6047,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2017-Analyzing properties of Deng entropy in the theory of evidence.pdf","parentItem":"7MCUFCJK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017-Analyzing properties of Deng entropy in the theory of evidence.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

However, traditional methods for selecting sustainable suppliers suffer from three main drawbacks: (i) Few existing studies have considered criteria weightings that have been determined both subjectively and objectively, reasonably and simultaneously. Moreover, among these limited studies, existing methods for combining weightings that have been calculated both subjectively and objectively provide only a poor degree of differentiation. (ii) Although MULTIMOORA method has high potential to solve the complex SSS problem, few researchers have given it much attention. (iii) The current Reference Point Approach within MULTIMOORA is not comprehensive as it only considers the distance between the alternative and the positive ideal point. Together, these drawbacks result in both inefficiency and ineffectiveness in SSS. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy MULTIMOORA-based method for SSS. The proposed method, firstly, obtains weights by both group Best Worst Method (subjective method) and fuzzy Shannon Entropy Method (objective method), respectively. Then the two types of weights are combined by Deviation Maximization method, reasonably and effectively. Finally, the paper introduces an improved fuzzy MULTIMOORA method to rank alternative suppliers, which considers both the minimum distance from the positive ideal point and the maximum distance from the negative ideal point. The practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in an illustrative application in Company L, a well-known international forklift truck manufacturer in China.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422000653","extra":"Citation Key: shang2022supplier","volume":"195","pages":"116567","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116567","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Shang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Barnes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Sustainable supply chain"},{"tag":"Supplier selection"},{"tag":"Fuzzy Shannon entropy"},{"tag":"Group BWM"},{"tag":"MULTIMOORA"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/7YE27I5N","itemID":1446,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493429,"version":0},"$loki":1263},{"itemID":671,"item":{"key":"7YJFRH3J","version":5500,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Modeling of compressible phase-change heat transfer in a Taylor-Bubble with application to pulsating heat pipe (PHP)","abstractNote":"The present work deals with the development of a compressible phasechange solver and implementation toward the numerical modeling and investigation of a part-unit cell of a pulsating heat pipe (PHP). The fundamental understanding of the working of the part-unit cell is imperative in the development of a complete Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a PHP. The compressible model developed in the present work is based on the Volume-of-Fluid solver of the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM, in which the contour-based interface reconstruction algorithm and the contact-line evaporation model have been incorporated. Owing to the lack of a single standard benchmark validation case for a compressible phase-change solver, a huge emphasis in the present work is laid on the solver development and validation, the latter part of which is conducted in stages. Furthermore, simulations for the formation of a Taylor-Bubble through a constrained bubble growth are performed and the fallacy of an incompressible solver is shown distinctly. The validated solver is used to model a part-unit cell of a PHP and a parametric study is performed on the part-unit cell.

In the BFT, a lot of rules to combine the available pieces of evidence have been proposed. The first one of them was Dempster’s rule of combination (DRC). It presents several drawbacks principally motivated by the normalization process used via a measure of conflict-based-combination between two pieces of evidence. This measure must be differentiated from conflict as an uncertainty-based-information measure of a piece of evidence in BFT. Many combination rules have been developed to solve the drawbacks that DRC presents, but each of them also has non-desirable behaviors in certain situations. In this work, we propose a set of mathematical properties that must be satisfied by every combination rule in BFT; we analyze some of the most known combination rules proposed in the literature, taking into account properties and behaviors. On the other hand, in this research, we present a new hybrid rule that verifies the required mathematical properties and does not present undesirable behaviors that other rules suffer. Finally, we show that the results of our proposal when it is used in practical applications are coherent.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421004280","extra":"Citation Key:

One-dimensional governing equations for the liquid and vapor phases are developed using available correlations to specify the shear stress and heat transfer coefficients. Steady-state solutions agree well with thermosyphon flooding data from several sources and with film thickness data obtained in the present investigation. While no data are available with which to compare the transient analysis, the results indicate that, for most systems, the governing time scale for system transients is the film residence time, which is typically much longer than the times required for viscous and thermal diffusion through the film. The proposed model offers a versatile and comprehensive analysis tool which is relatively simple.","date":"1987-08-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/heattransfer/article/109/3/722/412609/Modeling-of-the-TwoPhase-Closed-Thermosyphon","accessDate":"2022-12-07T02:39:14Z","extra":"Citation Key: reed1987modeling","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"109","pages":"722-730","publicationTitle":"Journal of Heat Transfer","DOI":"10.1115/1.3248150","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Heat Transfer","ISSN":"0022-1481, 1528-8943","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

Water and refrigerant R134a were selected as working ﬂuids. A novel and comprehensive three-dimensional CFD model of a wickless heat pipe was developed to simulate both the complex multiphase heat and mass transfer characteristics of boiling and condensation and the heat transfer characteristics of the cooling ﬂuid in the condenser e heat exchanger. The CFD simulation has successfully predicted, for the ﬁrst time, a boiling regime and two phase ﬂow pattern that takes place with water at low power throughput, known as geyser boiling. The effects of the power throughput on the characteristics of the geyser boiling were investigated. The CFD simulation was also successful in modelling and visualising the multiphase ﬂow characteristics, emphasising the difference in pool boiling behaviour between these working ﬂuids. Temperature proﬁles and visual validation of the resulting 3D CDF ﬁndings were conducted using two experimental facilities.","date":"10/2016","language":"en","archive":"Q2","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"7.1389","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360319915319170","accessDate":"2022-12-07T03:06:59Z","rights":"6.200","extra":"Citation Key: jouhara2016threedimensional","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"41","pages":"16463-16476","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.02.038","issue":"37","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","ISSN":"03603199","creators":[{"firstName":"Hussam","lastName":"Jouhara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bandar","lastName":"Fadhl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luiz C.","lastName":"Wrobel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T03:06:59Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/92JTYM4Y","itemID":642,"attachments":[{"key":"45NB6A7U","version":6041,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2016-Three-dimensional CFD simulation of geyser boiling in a two-phase closed.pdf","parentItem":"92JTYM4Y","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2016-Three-dimensional CFD simulation of geyser boiling in a two-phase closed.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/1\">Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/2\">Mathematical model</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/2\">Continuity equation for VOF model (volume fraction equation)</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/3\">Momentum equation for VOF model</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/4\">Energy equation for VOF model</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/4\">Model geometry and computational mesh</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/4\">Boundary conditions and CFD solution procedure</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/6\">Flow visualisation of CFD simulation results</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/7\">Geyser boiling</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/7\">Three-dimensional CFD simulation of a water-filled thermosyphon for a power throughput of 30 W</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/9\">Three-dimensional CFD simulation of a water-filled thermosyphon for a power throughput of 220 W</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/11\">A transparent glass thermosyphon experimental apparatus and procedure</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/11\">Experimental structure</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/12\">Experimental procedure</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/12\">Experimental discussion</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/12\">Three-dimensional CFD simulation of A R134a-filled thermosyphon for a power throughput of 30 W</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/13\">Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_FM5QTAFJ/14\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T05:41:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-07T05:41:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/45NB6A7U","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\45NB6A7U\\2016-Three-dimensional CFD simulation of geyser boiling in a two-phase closed.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1149/2016-Three-dimensional CFD simulation of geyser boiling in a two-phase closed.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493478,"version":0},"$loki":1274},{"itemID":1415,"item":{"key":"96PFLSUH","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Maximal association analysis using logical formulas over soft sets","abstractNote":"Discovering interesting and useful association rules from the collected data is an issue of great importance in pattern mining.

With the help of logical formulas over soft sets, all critical concepts for mining both regular and maximal association rules are incorporated into a common framework, and uniform mathematical characterizations of these concepts are provided accordingly. Three algorithms are also designed to develop a new approach to maximal association rule mining using logical formulas over soft sets. Moreover, we present two examples to show theoretical value of the obtained results and practical applicability of the proposed approach. The first example relies on a clinical diagnosis data set and illustrates the advantages of applying logical formula over soft sets to rule extraction. In the second example, we conduct a case study based on a data set regarding Nobel Laureates to show that the proposed approach is helpful for discovering interesting facts in real-world scenarios.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742030381X","extra":"Citation Key: feng2020maximal","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"159","pages":"113557","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113557","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Feng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald R.","lastName":"Yager","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José Carlos","lastName":"R.

Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image.

In this context, flood extent mapping is important for damage and accurate and timely information about flood-affected areas are needed. Due to the suitability of remote sensing in mapping flood inundation, multi-source satellite images have been used in recent years. This paper presents a new approach to representing and modeling uncertainty in spatio-temporal information of satellite images using belief function theory for flooded areas extraction. Interval approaches and the associated arithmetic operations are used for modeling the uncertainty of spatial locations and temporal durations from 2D dimensional model in order to take the direction of flow in the flood. Based on topological spatial relationships, the similarity for the spatio-temporal inundation events is performed and the similar intervals are fused. Detailed examples are given to illustrate each step. A case study of flood risk in Chad Lake from 2003 to 2019 using Sentinel-2, MODIS and Landsat-8 images shows how spatio-temporal uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of even the simplest flood mapping, and how coupling a Dempster–Shafer approach with topological relationships nevertheless offers a useful solution.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422013665","extra":"Citation Key: chehibi2022representing","volume":"209","pages":"118212","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118212","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Chehibi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ahlem","lastName":"Ferchichi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Imed Riadh","lastName":"Farah","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief function theory"},{"tag":"Flood mapping"},{"tag":"Spatial–temporal uncertainty"},{"tag":"Topological spatial relationships"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:52:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9DCDH6D4","itemID":1474,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493631,"version":0},"$loki":1280},{"itemID":1468,"item":{"key":"9EQV4NWJ","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Performance analysis of fingerprinting indoor positioning methods with BLE","abstractNote":"Indoor positioning with smartphone-compatible technologies has fostered much research attention in recent years. In this context, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) reveals a good performance for this type of task. It offers more flexibility and better achievements when compared with similar systems based on IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) technology, especially for fingerprinting-based positioning systems. The literature on these systems is rich and growing; however, not all its possible algorithms have been tested and compared under similar conditions for this emergence technology. This work presents a thorough analysis of the state of the art on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) algorithms used for fingerprinting systems. Based on this study, a novel scheme for fingerprinting methods classification is proposed. Then, a performance comparison between the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) databases is carried out, assessing training time, parameter optimization, computational time, and positioning accuracy. For the sake of completeness, a new database is provided and compared with the others to analyze how the environment can affect the accuracy of each method. The results show that those techniques based on the Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (Wk-NN) algorithm perform better on average for large scale deployments; besides, they do not require any previous training and consume less time to optimize their parameters. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines (SVM) provides the best accuracy with less computational and training time in small environments.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005012","extra":"Citation Key: aranda2022performance","volume":"202","pages":"117095","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117095","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Fernando J.","lastName":"Aranda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Parralejo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fernando J.","lastName":"Álvarez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José A.","lastName":"Paredes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BLE"},{"tag":"Fingerprinting"},{"tag":"Indoor positioning"},{"tag":"Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)"},{"tag":"Support Vector Machines (SVM)"},{"tag":"Weighted -Nearest Neighbours (W-NN)"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:52:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9EQV4NWJ","itemID":1468,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493634,"version":0},"$loki":1281},{"itemID":1459,"item":{"key":"9JBLV9M4","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An objective evaluation method for automated vehicle virtual test","abstractNote":"Reasonable test scenarios and objective evaluation methods could rapidly promote the development of autonomous technology. The current quantitative evaluation method of automated vehicles could comprehensively evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems rather than only focused on effectiveness. However, it needed massive participation of experts, which led to the strong subjectivity for the evaluation result. In order to reduce the participation of experts and implement automatic test evaluation, especially in the virtual environment, an objective automated vehicle evaluation method was proposed. The proposed methodology utilized the idea of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). It combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the improved criteria importance though intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method to determine the weight of the evaluation index. Then the adaptive grey relational analysis (GRA) algorithm was implemented to evaluate the performance of the automated vehicle. The experiment in a virtual environment scenario showed that the evaluation results of the proposed method had high consistency with the traditional human intervention evaluation algorithm. Meanwhile, it reduced the subjectivity and saved the cost of inviting a large number of experts to participate in the evaluation.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422011794","extra":"Citation Key: zhao2022objective","volume":"206","pages":"117940","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117940","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shijie","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ziru","lastName":"Wei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pengyu","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianfei","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Konghui","lastName":"Guo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Grey relational analysis"},{"tag":"Automated vehicles"},{"tag":"CRITIC method"},{"tag":"Multi-Criteria Decision Making"},{"tag":"Virtual scenario test"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:52:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9JBLV9M4","itemID":1459,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493639,"version":0},"$loki":1282},{"itemID":1520,"item":{"key":"9KTPS7R6","version":5677,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"论如何构建企业营销道德","abstractNote":"本文从道德营销研究的产生、发展和道德营销的主要理论入手,分别从产品、价格、促销、分销、政府交往和公共关系六个方面阐述了在企业营销活动中存在的非道德的营销行为以及这些行为对消费者、社会和企业本身造成的危害,并分析了影响企业营销道德建设的内、外部环境因素,有针对性地制定了构建企业营销道德的方案。","date":"2007","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=28&recid=&FileName=FZSL200710545&DbName=CJFD2007&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:56Z","extra":"Citation Key: chen2007lun","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"918-919","publicationTitle":"法制与社会","issue":"10","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"法制与社会","ISSN":"1009-0592","creators":[{"name":"陈鹏","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"李恕平","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"企业文化","type":1},{"tag":"企业营销道德构建","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:57Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9KTPS7R6","itemID":1520,"attachments":[{"key":"LY8DM6ZG","version":6053,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2007-论如何构建企业营销道德.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lVhEUd63zHhb9MPruZpPqN4Foi%2bOwDOYcQ%2bNHEqHJ1%2b0I0%2bJoqgqnC8Zx0Mb5%2bQ7YUtqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSE5tsOBdz7R6iAcyWGh6ObQ6opkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:23:09Z","parentItem":"9KTPS7R6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2007-论如何构建企业营销道德.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:23:09Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:23:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LY8DM6ZG","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\LY8DM6ZG\\2007-论如何构建企业营销道德.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1527/2007-论如何构建企业营销道德.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493644,"version":0},"$loki":1283},{"itemID":1249,"item":{"key":"9P3GVDZG","version":5507,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Entropy and Specificity in a Mathematical Theory of Evidence","abstractNote":"We review Shafer's theory of evidence.

All these prediction approaches are still in the rudimentary phase. Experiments and research are conducting to build a robust model. Software Fault Prediction (SFP) is the process to develop the model which can be utilized by software practitioners to detect faulty classes/module before the testing phase. Prediction of defective modules before the testing phase will help the software development team leader to allocate resources more optimally and it reduces the testing effort. In this article, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of various studies from 1990 to June 2019 towards applying machine learning and statistical method over software fault prediction. We have cited 208 research articles, in which we studied 154 relevant articles. We investigated the competence of machine learning in existing datasets and research projects. To the best of our knowledge, the existing SLR considered only a few parameters over SFP’s performance, and they partially examined the various threats and challenges of SFP techniques. In this article, we aggregated those parameters and analyzed them accordingly, and we also illustrate the different challenges in the SFP domain. We also compared the performance between machine learning and statistical techniques based on SFP models. Our empirical study and analysis demonstrate that the prediction ability of machine learning techniques for classifying class/module as fault/non-fault prone is better than classical statistical models. The performance of machine learning-based SFP methods over fault susceptibility is better than conventional statistical purposes. The empirical evidence of our survey reports that the machine learning techniques have the capability, which can be used to identify fault proneness, and able to form well-generalized result. We have also investigated a few challenges in fault prediction discipline, i.e., quality of data, over-fitting of models, and class imbalance problem. We have also summarized 154 articles in a tabular form for quick identification.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421000361","extra":"Citation Key: pandey2021machine","volume":"172","pages":"114595","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114595","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sushant Kumar","lastName":"Pandey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ravi Bhushan","lastName":"Mishra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Tripathi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Fault prediction"},{"tag":"Fault proneness"},{"tag":"Statistical techniques"},{"tag":"Systematic literature review"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9P6LASJY","itemID":1447,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493656,"version":0},"$loki":1285},{"itemID":928,"item":{"key":"9P8C9Q9Q","version":5502,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Information volume of mass function based on extropy","abstractNote":"The information volume of mass function based on extropy is proposed in this paper. Although the information volume of the probability distribution can be calculated by Shannon entropy, how to calculate the information of the mass function is still being explored. Recently, the concept of extropy was proposed by Lad et al. Based on extropy, the information volume of mass function is proposed in this paper. For a basic probability assignment function (BPA), if the focal elements of the frame of discernment (FOD) are all single elements, the information volume proposed in this paper is equal to the corresponding extropy. Otherwise, the information volume is greater than the corresponding extropy. Besides, when the cardinality of the FOD is identical, both the total uncertainty case and the mass function distribution of the maximum extropy have the same information volume. More precisely, the distribution of the latter can be regarded as the former obtained by decomposing the BPA once. Finally, the experiment proves that the maximum information volume increases with the increase in the cardinality of the FOD, and has the same limit value log2e as the maximum extropy. Some numerical examples are given to prove the nature of the information volume.","date":"03/2022","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能3区  计算机：跨学科应用3区","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00500-021-06410-z","accessDate":"2023-03-14T14:09:01Z","extra":"Citation Key: liu2022information","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"26","pages":"2409-2418","publicationTitle":"Soft Computing","DOI":"10.1007/s00500-021-06410-z","issue":"5","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Comput","ISSN":"1432-7643, 1433-7479","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fuyuan","lastName":"Xiao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-14T14:09:01Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9P8C9Q9Q","itemID":928,"attachments":[{"key":"MTSUEEAX","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2022-Information volume of mass function based on extropy.pdf","parentItem":"9P8C9Q9Q","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2022-Information volume of mass function based on extropy.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/1\">Abstract</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/2\">2 Preliminaries</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/2\">2.1 Dempster–Shafer evidence theory</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/2\">2.2 Shannon entropy</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/2\">2.3 Extropy</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/3\">2.4 Deng entropy</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/3\">3 The proposed model</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/3\">4 Numerical examples and discussion</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/8\">5 Conclusion</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_NHMJLAZQ/9\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-14T14:09:10Z","dateModified":"2023-03-14T14:09:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/MTSUEEAX","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\MTSUEEAX\\2022-Information volume of mass function based on extropy.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1135/2022-Information volume of mass function based on extropy.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493662,"version":0},"$loki":1286},{"itemID":523,"item":{"key":"9UBLRPAQ","version":5499,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"An experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at water and ethanol pool boiling at low and high heat fluxes","abstractNote":"In this paper the results of experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at pool boiling of various liquids in a wide range of heat ﬂuxes up to q/qCHF $ 0.9 are presented.

As a result, new data on the growth rate of vapor bubbles and dry spots in their base, evolution of the liquid microlayer region and unsteady temperature ﬁeld of a thin ﬁlm heater surface were obtained, and analysis of patterns of process at low heat ﬂuxes was carried out. The usage of high-speed experimental techniques also allowed in this study to investigate the evolution of vapor bubbles with formation of vapor patterns and large agglomerates, to study dry spots dynamics, to estimate void fraction close to heating surface at fully developed nucleate boiling regime up to the critical heat ﬂux depending on liquid properties. Obtained experimental information can be further used to construct more accurate physical models for the theoretical description of microcharacteristics, heat transfer and boiling trigger mechanisms at nucleate boiling of liquids with different physical properties.","date":"11/2018","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0017931018309396","accessDate":"2022-11-23T02:16:12Z","extra":"Citation Key: surtaev2018experimental","volume":"126","pages":"297-311","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.06.001","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","ISSN":"00179310","creators":[{"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Surtaev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Serdyukov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Pavlenko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladislav","lastName":"Tumanov","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ponyo's Heat Tube @stemfellowship"}],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-23T02:16:12Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/9UBLRPAQ","itemID":523,"attachments":[{"key":"ATSAPAJF","version":6036,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2018-An experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at water and ethanol pool.pdf","parentItem":"9UBLRPAQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2018-An experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at water and ethanol pool.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/3\">2 Experimental setup and techniques</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/3\">2.1 Experimental setup and test section</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/3\">2.2 Video and infrared high speed visualizations</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/4\">3 Results and discussion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/4\">3.1 Boiling curves</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/4\">3.2 Vapor bubble dynamic at low heat fluxes</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/7\">3.3 Dry spot growth rate</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/8\">3.4 The dynamics of vapor bubbles at moderate and high heat fluxes (fully developed nucleate boiling regime)</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/13\">4 Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/14\">Conflict of Interest</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/14\">Acknowledgment</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RUQKJZNQ/14\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-23T02:16:49Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T02:16:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ATSAPAJF","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\ATSAPAJF\\2018-An experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at water and ethanol pool.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1099/2018-An experimental study of vapor bubbles dynamics at water and ethanol pool.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493667,"version":0},"$loki":1287},{"itemID":1453,"item":{"key":"9VR62YYU","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Best practices in analytic network process studies","abstractNote":"It has been more than 20 years since the appearance of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) in the scientific literature.

However, the RO components of a corrupted image could be decimated by the procedure of image denoising. We suggest that the RO property should be utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks, extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information.

assessment in failure mode and effects analysis using a hybrid probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic MCDM method","abstractNote":"Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) usually requires multi-domain specialists to implement the group risk assessment for identifying and eliminating system failures. Therefore, this paper combines several multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques with probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PHFLTSs) to implement risk assessment of failure modes by a panel of specialists. It aims at overcoming some defects existing in the conventional FMEA, such as without epistemic uncertainty and group risk assessment, as well as with some questions incurring from the risk priority number (RPN). Consequently, group members utilize PHFLTSs to express their subjective uncertain risk assessments on failure modes, in which the social network analysis (SNA) and maximizing consensus method (MCM) are exploited to derive the subjective and objective weights of group members respectively, afterwards their integrated weights are employed to aggregate individual risk assessments into the collective risk assessment. Additionally, the subjective and objective weights of risk factors are garnered by the best-worst method (BWM) and maximizing deviation method (MDM) separately, from which their integrated weights are incorporated into the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) so as to obtain the risk ranking of failure modes. Finally, an example with sensitive and comparative analyses is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421013609","extra":"Citation Key: wang2022group","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"188","pages":"116013","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116013","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhi-Chao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Genbao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Best-worst method"},{"tag":"Failure mode and effects analysis"},{"tag":"Multi-criteria decision making"},{"tag":"Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets"},{"tag":"Social network analysis"},{"tag":"TOPSIS"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AW2R9BSZ","itemID":1423,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493715,"version":0},"$loki":1296},{"itemID":1359,"item":{"key":"AZQIWENR","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Rank-One Prior: Real-Time Scene Recovery","abstractNote":"Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task with several practical applications, including video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. In this paper, we provide a new real-time scene recovery framework to restore degraded images under different weather/imaging conditions, such as underwater, sand dust and haze. A degraded image can actually be seen as a superimposition of a clear image with the same color imaging environment (underwater, sand or haze, etc.). Mathematically, we can introduce a rank-one matrix to characterize this phenomenon, i.e., rank-one prior (ROP). Using the prior, a direct method with the complexity O(N ) is derived for real-time recovery. For general cases, we develop ROP+ to further improve the recovery performance. Comprehensive experiments of the scene recovery illustrate that our method outperforms competitively several state-of-the-art imaging methods in terms of efﬁciency and robustness.","date":"2023","language":"en","shortTitle":"Rank-One Prior","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能1区  工程：电子与电气1区","callNumber":"24.3134","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969127/","accessDate":"2023-04-04T09:24:29Z","rights":"25.6515","extra":"Citation Key: liu2023rankone","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"1-17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3226276","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Ieee T Pattern Anal","ISSN":"0162-8828, 2160-9292, 1939-3539","creators":[{"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryan Wen","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianing","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tieyong","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-04T09:24:29Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AZQIWENR","itemID":1359,"attachments":[{"key":"5KQC599J","version":6049,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2023-Rank-One Prior.pdf","parentItem":"AZQIWENR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2023-Rank-One Prior.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-04T09:24:17Z","dateModified":"2023-04-05T05:01:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5KQC599J","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\5KQC599J\\2023-Rank-One Prior.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1358/2023-Rank-One Prior.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493720,"version":0},"$loki":1297},{"itemID":1217,"item":{"key":"B4R5FYGN","version":5504,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Entropy with respect to plausibility measures","date":"1982","extra":"Citation Key: hohle1982entropy","proceedingsTitle":"Proc. of 12th IEEE int.

Because of the ﬂexibility and eﬀectiveness in modeling and processing the uncertain information regardless of prior probabilities, Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is widely applied in a variety of ﬁelds of information fusion. However, counter-intuitive results may come out when fusing the highly conﬂicting evidences. In order to deal with this problem, a novel method for multi-sensor data fusion based on a new belief divergence measure of evidences and the belief entropy was proposed. First, a new Belief Jensen–Shannon divergence is devised to measure the discrepancy and conﬂict degree between the evidences; then, the credibility degree can be obtained to represent the reliability of the evidences. Next, considering the uncertainties of the evidences, the information volume of the evidences are measured by making use of the belief entropy to indicate the relative importance of the evidences. Afterwards, the credibility degree of each evidence is modiﬁed by taking advantage of the quantitative information volume which will be utilized to obtain an appropriate weight in terms of each evidence. Ultimately, the ﬁnal weights of the evidences are applied to adjust the bodies of the evidences before using the Dempster’s combination rule. A numerical example is illustrated that the proposed method is feasible and effective in handling the conﬂicting evidences, where the belief value of target increases to 99.05%. Furthermore, an application in fault diagnosis is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

However, when the stochastic process to be measured cannot be accurately modeled, i.e., it is more sense to describe the phenomenon with an interval, the stochastic process needs a more general method to represent. In this paper, the interval-valued stochastic process is modeled with the basic belief assignment in an ordered frame of discernment and the corresponding belief entropy rate is proposed to measure its uncertainty. Two common stochastic processes are discussed. The first is the case of independent identically distributed stochastic processes, where the belief entropy rate is formally the same as the Shannon entropy rate. The second is Markov processes. We construct the evidential Markov chain and calculate its belief entropy rate. Compared with the Shannon entropy rate, the belief entropy rate is easier to implement the Markov chains. By validating in real dataset, the proposed method can better deal with interval information with stronger practicability. When encountering tiny disturbances, the variance of the Shannon entropy rate is more than 50 times the variance of the belief entropy rate, which reflects the stronger robustness of the belief entropy rate.","date":"2023-01-05","language":"en","shortTitle":"Belief entropy rate","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能3区","callNumber":"5.0187","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10489-022-04407-1","accessDate":"2023-03-30T07:46:04Z","rights":"4.7603","extra":"Citation Key: wang2023belief","seriesTitle":"无","publicationTitle":"Applied Intelligence","DOI":"10.1007/s10489-022-04407-1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Intell","ISSN":"0924-669X, 1573-7497","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T07:46:04Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BIEXECE2","itemID":1330,"attachments":[{"key":"6LCQDP5N","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang 等 - 2023 - Belief entropy rate a method to measure the uncer.pdf","parentItem":"BIEXECE2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang 等 - 2023 - Belief entropy rate a method to measure the uncer.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T07:45:55Z","dateModified":"2023-03-30T07:46:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6LCQDP5N","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\6LCQDP5N\\Wang 等 - 2023 - Belief entropy rate a method to measure the uncer.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1329/Wang 等 - 2023 - Belief entropy rate a method to measure the uncer.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493788,"version":0},"$loki":1301},{"itemID":419,"item":{"key":"BIW25AZK","version":5497,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Assessment Of Data Fusion Systems","abstractNote":"With growing emphasis on research and applications in data fusion, it is important to know how to measure fusion system performance. While much of the current research is involved with evaluating fusion systems based on the quality of their outputs, this paper describes the expansion of this scope to include the complexity of the inputs. Since the quality of the outputs is highly dependent on the difficulty of the input scenario, the methodology described in this paper provides us with a more well-rounded interpretation of fusion system performance. Moreover, characterization and quantification of input scenarios allows for the creation and variation of test scenarios, leading to more efficient optimization of fusion systems. A series of complexity and performance metrics were designed according to a common standard to measure the various aspects of the input scenario and the fusion system solution. Finally, these metrics are combined to obtain an assessment index which provides a description of the fusion system performance.","date":"07/2006","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4086097/","accessDate":"2022-11-14T14:23:29Z","extra":"Citation Key: ng2006assessment","place":"Florence","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-4244-0953-2 978-0-9721844-6-5","pages":"1-8","proceedingsTitle":"2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion","conferenceName":"2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion","DOI":"10.1109/ICIF.2006.301811","creators":[{"firstName":"Gee","lastName":"Ng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chung","lastName":"Tan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thiam","lastName":"Ng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Siow","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/PXWWM8XE"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-14T14:19:22Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BIW25AZK","itemID":419,"attachments":[{"key":"J96QL8PG","version":6039,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Assessment Of Data Fusion Systems.pdf","parentItem":"BIW25AZK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2006-Assessment Of Data Fusion Systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XW35ID9F"]},"dateAdded":"2022-12-27T14:42:29Z","dateModified":"2022-12-27T14:42:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/J96QL8PG","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\J96QL8PG\\2006-Assessment Of Data Fusion Systems.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1125/2006-Assessment Of Data Fusion Systems.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493793,"version":0},"$loki":1302},{"itemID":615,"item":{"key":"BJJBYWQN","version":5499,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data","abstractNote":"We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multirelational data in low-dimensional vector spaces.

Choquet integral preference model is employed to capture the interaction, importance and tolerance of criteria, all of which are specific to decision makers (DMs). Some mandatory/sufficient requirements concerning criteria which are global or local, also called the tolerance attitudes of DMs, are quantified as tolerability constraints. Preference disaggregation analysis is extended to solve this type of tolerability constraints for preference elicitation. Confronted with the inconsistency issue (the feasibility of the whole preference constraints translated from indirect preference information), cause oriented strategy and consequence oriented strategy are established by regression-based mixed 0–1 integer linear programs with the objectives of the most credible minimal inconsistent preference constraints and the most credible maximal preference constraints in the context of group decision making. Considering a wide range of the minimal unsatisfied subsets of preference constraints responsible for the inconsistency and the maximum satisfied subsets of preference constraints as a consistent result, to reach a robust decision, stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA)-like simulation analysis is generated to examine the whole instances of compatible preference models in the modified feasible preference polyhedron and compute the result in a probabilistic form. Simulation experiment is conducted to investigate the influence of global tolerance attitudes of DMs on preference elicitation in conservative and radical scenarios. Finally, the application of the proposed approach to a credit ranking of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the comparison analysis with objective methods are presented and discussed for the effectiveness of the proposed tolerance framework.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422013641","extra":"Citation Key: yang2022tolerance","volume":"208","pages":"118208","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118208","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yelin","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George Q.","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weihao","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Choquet integral preference model"},{"tag":"Monte-Carlo simulation"},{"tag":"Robust group multiple criteria decision making"},{"tag":"Tolerance framework"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BLSFYEQV","itemID":1440,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493801,"version":0},"$loki":1304},{"itemID":190,"item":{"key":"BMQHXXIP","version":5494,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Effect of Dog Videos on Subjective and Physiological Responses to Stress","date":"2022-05-04","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927936.2021.1999606","accessDate":"2022-11-01T11:50:56Z","extra":"Citation Key: Ein2022","volume":"35","pages":"463-482","publicationTitle":"Anthrozoös","DOI":"10.1080/08927936.2021.1999606","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Anthrozoös","ISSN":"0892-7936, 1753-0377","creators":[{"firstName":"Natalie","lastName":"Ein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maureen J.","lastName":"Reed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristin","lastName":"Vickers","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["GSXRUD79"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-01T11:50:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BMQHXXIP","itemID":190,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493804,"version":0},"$loki":1305},{"itemID":493,"item":{"key":"BQU5JHEG","version":5498,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Theoretical and experimental modelling of an open oscillatory heat pipe including gravity","abstractNote":"An open oscillatory heat pipe is a two-phase ﬂow device capable of transferring heat from a source to a sink below the source, against the force of gravity, without the aid of a wick or any moving mechanical parts. A theoretical model of such a device taking gravity, surface tension, friction and pressure into account is presented. The model uses vapour bubble, liquid plug and liquid ﬁlm control volumes. An experimental model was constructed and tested using water as the working ﬂuid. It was found that the device could operate indeﬁnitely provided the heat source is less than 30 mm above the heat sink and that the temperature of the heat source is less than 160 ◦C. The theoretical model was able to predict these experimentally determined values. By calculating Lyapunov exponents it is shown that the theoretical model is able to reﬂect the characteristic chaotic behaviour of these devices.

Thus, this paper defines mass Jensen–Shannon divergence (MJSD) to reflect the conflict degree. MJSD considers both the external difference and the external difference of the mass function. Furthermore, this paper proposes an enhanced mass Jensen–Shannon divergence (EMJSD). EMJSD has all the advantages of MJSD. It is a distance-like measure, which satisfies some axiom of distance measure, such as non-negativity and symmetry. Compared with the current methods, EMJSD fully measures the internal and external difference between the mass functions. Therefore, EJMSD overcomes the drawbacks of the classical methods when measuring differences between mass functions. Some numerical examples are used to explain its properties and advantages. Additionally, this paper presents a new method to fuse multi-source information. A numerical example shows that this fusion method is more useful for decision-making under the framework of multi-source information fusion. We then construct a new generation method of mass function in the data-driven environment. The experimental results show that when compared with other method, the new generation method more accurately reflects the support degree of proposition. Finally, this paper applies the generated mass functions to the new fusion method and other methods. The results indicate that the new fusion method has better recognition performance in practical applications.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422012702","extra":"Citation Key: pan2022enhanced","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"209","pages":"118065","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118065","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaozhuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kang Hao","lastName":"Cheong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Conflict"},{"tag":"Enhanced mass Jensen–Shannon divergence"},{"tag":"Information fusion"},{"tag":"Mass function"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BU9ZBPJP","itemID":1424,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493812,"version":0},"$loki":1307},{"itemID":990,"item":{"key":"BYZPBSBY","version":5503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A generalized divergence of information volume and its applications","abstractNote":"Dempster–Shafer evidence theory provides a powerful method for the expression and fusion of uncertain information. When handling the high conflict information, traditional Dempster combination rule can produce counterintuitive results. Hence, the reasonable conflict measure is essential in information fusion. Inspired by this view, the paper propose the new method to measure conflict between bodies of evidence. Firstly, we define a new information volume of mass function for the perspective of information discord and non-specificity. Second, we propose a generalized divergence based on information volume of mass function, denoted as Jensen–Shannon divergence of information volume (𝐼𝐽 𝑆). 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 can effectively measure the conflict between bodies of evidence. 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 reflects the conflict between bodies of evidence in terms of the differences between the support of propositions and the elements. That is, compared to the current approach, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 not only fully considers the differences between the support degree of propositions, but also the differences of elements in propositions from the perspective of information non-specificity. When the mass function degenerates to a probabilistic distribution, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 also degenerates to the classical Jensen–Shannon divergence. Meanwhile, 𝐼𝐽 𝑆 also satisfies the axioms of distance measure, such as non-negativity, symmetry and etc. Further, we proved these axioms based on mathematical derivation, and some numerical examples are applied to explain axioms and advantages. Based on the proposed divergence measure, we propose a multi-source information fusion method in the real world, and several data sets can be used to show that the proposed fusion method is superior to current method under the framework of evidence theory.","date":"02/2022","language":"en","archive":"Q1","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197621004164","accessDate":"2023-03-19T04:56:33Z","rights":"6.6936","extra":"Citation Key: gao2022generalized","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"108","pages":"104584","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104584","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"09521976","creators":[{"firstName":"Xiaozhuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-19T04:56:33Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/BYZPBSBY","itemID":990,"attachments":[{"key":"T5HQTNZ6","version":6034,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gao 等 - 2022 - A generalized divergence of information volume and.pdf","parentItem":"BYZPBSBY","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gao 等 - 2022 - A generalized divergence of information volume and.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-19T04:56:20Z","dateModified":"2023-03-19T04:56:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/T5HQTNZ6","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\T5HQTNZ6\\Gao 等 - 2022 - A generalized divergence of information volume and.pdf","defaultPath":"files/989/Gao 等 - 2022 - A generalized divergence of information volume and.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493817,"version":0},"$loki":1308},{"itemID":1355,"item":{"key":"C5WU2KZ5","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A fuzzy extension of Saaty's priority theory","date":"1983","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: 1983fuzzy","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"11","pages":"229–241","publicationTitle":"Fuzzy Sets and Systems.

We propose a deﬁnition of the rolling resistance force and torque, and carry out experiments with a basketball and medicine ball rolling on a bed of gravel to measure the corresponding rolling resistance coefﬁcients. These experiments reveal, in good agreement with literature, coefﬁcients that are velocityindependent, and show that little to no plowing of the spheres into the granular substrate occurs. This indicates a regime of motion distinctly different from those treated in previous works. A simpliﬁed model correctly predicts the velocity independence and suggests an inverse dependence of the rolling resistance coefﬁcient on the reduced inertia of the ball. These predictions match the experimentally observed behavior. Numerical simulations based on soft-sphere DEM shed more light on the mechanics of energy dissipation that occur in this no-plowing regime, and reveal a mass dependency that is not captured by the model.

However, the accuracy of fault diagnosis results is easily impaired by the data imbalance in real-world applications. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to address the mentioned problem. Specifically, spatial and temporal information of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data is extracted, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to obtain the data representations correlated with the health conditions. Additionally, the bollards of the data distributions are determined in the representation space, and they are matched with the data centers of each health state. Under this circumstance, the unexpected effects of data imbalance on data representations are relieved, leading to effective decision boundaries regardless of the sample numbers. Then, a classifier is trained on the learned representations to recognize the faults in wind turbines. Compared with several baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, the impressive performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulated data and actual measurements from a utility-scale wind turbine. This research provides useful insights into the efficient development of wind energy with data-driven intelligent systems.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423003925","extra":"Citation Key: sun2023matching","volume":"223","pages":"119891","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119891","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shilin","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenyang","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuekai","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianyang","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fulei","lastName":"Chu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Artificial intelligence"},{"tag":"Fault diagnosis"},{"tag":"Operation and maintenance"},{"tag":"Wind turbine"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CD8N26DR","itemID":1460,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493837,"version":0},"$loki":1313},{"itemID":1509,"item":{"key":"CEFZ3MLG","version":5676,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"实行道德营销 建立企业竞争优势","abstractNote":"现有的营销道德理论都把营销道德作为企业的一种社会责任来加以理解和阐述。营销道德不仅仅是企业的社会责任,还可以成为企业提高竞争力的手段。在企业营销道德观念普遍薄弱的情况下,有良好道德的企业实行道德营销有利于建立自己的竞争优势。","date":"2006","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=16&recid=&FileName=NCXB200602011&DbName=CJFD2006&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:18Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhou2006shi","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"54-57","publicationTitle":"内蒙古财经学院学报","issue":"2","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"内蒙古财经学院学报","ISSN":"1004-5295","creators":[{"name":"周建设","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"袁春平","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"费明胜","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"传导途径","type":1},{"tag":"措施","type":1},{"tag":"竞争力","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:18Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CEFZ3MLG","itemID":1509,"attachments":[{"key":"AAHKRTS5","version":6054,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-实行道德营销 建立企业竞争优势.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lWB1MicG36NOq20clzJNtgNH%2baLmkDLv%2bEsl5%2f0QJVlG9RR%2bm%2fZ5QcK76oOxDrYoPctqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSEAFLzc%2ffoMS7jfaHwOvRPN6opkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:26Z","parentItem":"CEFZ3MLG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2006-实行道德营销 建立企业竞争优势.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:26Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:22:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AAHKRTS5","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\AAHKRTS5\\2006-实行道德营销 建立企业竞争优势.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1510/2006-实行道德营销 建立企业竞争优势.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493842,"version":0},"$loki":1314},{"itemID":1437,"item":{"key":"CF68QF8M","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Extended Hapicare: A telecare system with probabilistic diagnosis and self-adaptive treatment","abstractNote":"The massive growth of the population with chronic diseases calls for a telecare system to enhance their quality of life and reduce their treatment costs. Most of the current solutions depend on reliable data, deterministic rules, or the similarity of patients, while studies have shown otherwise. To this end, in this paper, we have extended our previous work on the Hapicare framework to integrate probabilistic diagnosis and self-adaptive treatment. Our new framework enables sensors’ datastream analysis and online decision-making. Its ontology-based reasoning uses Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) ontology to add contextual information to the collected data. Moreover, probabilistic reasoning is applied for diagnosis and screening to manage the uncertainty and unreliability of data as well as the indeterministic medical rules. The treatment system is designed to be modifiable by the experts and automatically adaptable to patients’ needs. The probabilistic diagnosis performance has been evaluated based on two public datasets regarding symptoms and risk factors of two chronic diseases: chronic kidney disease and dermatologic disease. The results show that our solution outperforms a classical classifier specifically when more than 40% of the data are missing. The proposed framework is also validated using four scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to help patients and doctors diagnose and treat medical conditions and episodes.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742101126X","extra":"Citation Key: kordestani2021extended","volume":"186","pages":"115749","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115749","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Hossain","lastName":"Kordestani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roghayeh","lastName":"Mojarad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdelghani","lastName":"Chibani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Barkaoui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Amirat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wagdy","lastName":"Zahran","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Answer set programming"},{"tag":"Bayesian reasoning"},{"tag":"Medical telemonitoring"},{"tag":"Self-adaptive systems"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CF68QF8M","itemID":1437,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493844,"version":0},"$loki":1315},{"itemID":1641,"item":{"key":"CGNTY39J","version":6081,"itemType":"document","title":"Google suspends chinese E-commerce app pinduoduo over malware","date":"March 22, 2023, 2023-03","language":"english","url":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/google-suspends-chinese-e-commerce-app-pinduoduo-over-malware/","accessDate":"2023-04-30","extra":"Pages: 1–2\nType: EB/OL\ntex.entrytype: digital\nCitation Key: security2023google","creators":[{"firstName":"Kerbs on","lastName":"Security","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/6HXD7T9Z"]},"dateAdded":"2023-04-30T13:35:08Z","dateModified":"2023-05-03T11:07:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CGNTY39J","itemID":1641,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493848,"version":0},"$loki":1316},{"itemID":1435,"item":{"key":"CR5CQZGY","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Distributed evidential clustering toward time series with big data issue","abstractNote":"To analyze time series data with large volume, most of the existing clustering algorithms focus on data reduction techniques or multi-level strategies.

To tackle above issues, we propose a distributed evidential clustering algorithm that can be directly adopted on the raw big data, and parallelize it under the Apache Spark, which is a processing engine built for sophisticated data analysis. Concretely, in a parallel way, the possibility of becoming a cluster center is first calculated for each data object under the framework of evidence theory. After drawing a decision graph, the cluster centers are determined and then a credal partition of the time series data is derived. Without simplifying the data structure, the proposed algorithm can not only detect the number of clusters, but also describe the ambiguity and uncertainty in memberships of every data object. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and one real-world problem show the strong scalability and well clustering performance of the introduced algorithm.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421015876","extra":"Citation Key: gong2022distributed","volume":"191","pages":"116279","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116279","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Chaoyu","lastName":"Gong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhi-gang","lastName":"Su","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pei-hong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"You","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Apache spark"},{"tag":"Big data"},{"tag":"Distributed calculation"},{"tag":"Evidential clustering"},{"tag":"Warped dissimilarity measure"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CR5CQZGY","itemID":1435,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493850,"version":0},"$loki":1317},{"itemID":1422,"item":{"key":"CSI9BJMQ","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The climate change Twitter dataset","abstractNote":"This work creates and makes publicly available the most comprehensive dataset to date regarding climate change and human opinions via Twitter.

Firstly, based on the possibility degree of intuitionistic fuzzy values, the possibility degree and divergence degree of IVIFVs are defined to provide a new order relation of IVIFVs. Subsequently in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MAGDM, an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model is constructed to derive decision makers' weights. Depending on the construction of membership and non-membership functions, three approaches are developed to solve the constructed intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model, including the optimistic, pessimistic and mixed approaches. Utilizing decision makers’ weights, the collective decision matrix is obtained. Combining the possibility and divergence degrees of alternatives on attributes, the adjusted possibility distribution matrix for each attribute is constructed and proved to be an interval fuzzy preference relation. Then the attribute weights are determined by the negative distances and the positive distances of adjusted possibility distribution matrices. Using the interval-valued intuitionistic weighted arithmetic aggregation operator, the collective comprehensive values of alternatives are obtained. The ranking order of alternatives is generated according to the proposed order relation of IVIFVs. Therefore, an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MAGDM method is proposed. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on some examples. Validation discussion and comparative analyses of this method is also done to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419306475","extra":"Citation Key: wang2020possibility","volume":"141","pages":"112929","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112929","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shuping","lastName":"Wan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Multi-attribute group decision making"},{"tag":"Divergence degree"},{"tag":"Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set"},{"tag":"Possibility degree"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/D27KZSM2","itemID":1473,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493868,"version":0},"$loki":1321},{"itemID":1226,"item":{"key":"D3GL2R5W","version":5505,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Information volume of fuzzy membership function","date":"2021","archive":"Q3","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"自动化与控制系统4区  计算机：信息系统4区","callNumber":"2.6349","rights":"1.9261","extra":"Citation Key: deng2021information","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"16","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Computers Communications & Control","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Comput Commun","creators":[{"firstName":"Jixiang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:46:10Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/D3GL2R5W","itemID":1226,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493910,"version":0},"$loki":1322},{"itemID":688,"item":{"key":"D6GICATL","version":5501,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"EVALUATION OF THE VAPOR THERMODYNAMIC STATE IN PHP","abstractNote":"Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) is a recently invented kind of thermal link of high thermal performance. The heat is transferred due to self-sustained oscillations of vapor bubbles and liquid plugs in a unique capillary tube which links the hot and cold sources in several turns or branches. Increasingly strong efforts are devoted to PHP simulation models which need to be experimentally assessed. Recent models show the importance of the thermodynamic state of the vapor bulk. Indeed it may deviate from the saturation conditions due to vapor transient compression/expansion. This study aims at measuring and calculating the vapor state in a horizontal single branch PHP which allows generating oscillations of a liquid meniscus in a capillary tube with one open end, at which the pressure is imposed. The experimental setup uses oxygen at cryogenic temperatures which reduces as much as possible the radiation losses of both sensors (microscopic thermocouple) used for the direct vapor temperature measurement and of the whole PHP. We present here the simultaneous experimental measurements of the vapor pressure and temperature. The data are compared to the theoretical modeling obtained within the film evaporation/condensation model of PHP [Das et al., 2010]. The model is extended to account for the thermal gradient along and across the tube walls formed because of the poor heat conductivity of its material. The vapor is found superheated, which demonstrates the relevance of the model. The vapor temperature oscillates around the evaporator temperature. The heat transfer between the vapor and the dry evaporator wall explains this result. The corresponding heat transfer coefficient is calculated using DNS. The comparison shows an agreement between the experiment and the model.","date":"2014","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/4b0844fc3a2ef17f,18c058f17ecbe0d2,273cd72b3a6d279c.html","accessDate":"2022-12-16T14:24:37Z","extra":"Citation Key: gully2014evaluation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"5","pages":"369-376","publicationTitle":"Heat Pipe Science and Technology, An International Journal","DOI":"10.1615/HeatPipeScieTech.v5.i1-4.410","issue":"1-4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Heat Pipe Scie Tech","ISSN":"2151-7975","creators":[{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Gully","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Bonnet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vadim S.","lastName":"Nikolayev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Luchier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.

However, the detection of insider threats is a more arduous task for many reasons. A significant cause is the availability of various data types related to insider activities and their possible behavioral drift. Another major reason is that threat activities rarely happen within any organizational environment and usually remain submerged within a massive amount of normal activities thereby creating data imbalance issues. Any insider threat event requires three major components to get materialized: proper motivation, suitable opportunity and a minimum skill set. The simultaneous occurrence of all these elements is rarely found in organizational environment compared to regular activity traits, and the data imbalance thus caused makes accurate detection of threat activities quite challenging. Existing insider threat detection techniques are mainly divided into statistical rule-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based methods. Although recent deep learning methods have been found to extract intrinsic behavioral properties from users’ activity patterns more effectively than traditional rule-based and machine-learning methods by utilizing their multilayer architecture. But sporadic approaches prioritize critical sections of activity patterns in their detection scheme. Also, rare methods focused on taking advantage of multiple deep learning-based feature extraction models together in their detection process. Finally, rare methods have adequately focused on data imbalance issues, especially over the unequal proportion of different categories of threat instances. In this paper, we proposed an insider threat detection approach using an ensemble of stacked-LSTM and stacked-GRU-based attention models. Our models are first trained on the user’s single-day sequential activity logs. Then a stacked ensemble of trained attention models is used to extract the user’s single-day activity information in the form of the feature vector, which is finally used for classification. To address the data imbalance issues, we propose a new equally-weighted random sampling approach for balancing the population of the different categories of threat patterns. We randomly undersample the nonmalicious instances followed by random oversampling of the different categories of threat instances in an equally-weighted manner so that the training models can learn the behavioral characteristics of the different types of insider activity patterns without getting biased towards any particular type, which is a major limitation of random oversampling and random undersampling-based techniques. Experiments have been performed on the different versions of the CMU CERT insider threat datasets. For robust evaluation, stratified division-based train-test sets have been used based on different categories of insider activities. An average AUC of 0.99 on CMU CERT v4.2 and v5.2 datasets and 0.97 on its v6.2 dataset shows the robustness of the proposed approach in detecting insider threats.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423004268","extra":"Citation Key: pal2023temporal","volume":"224","pages":"119925","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119925","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Swarnkar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Attention model"},{"tag":"Equally-weighted random sampling"},{"tag":"GRU"},{"tag":"Imbalanced data"},{"tag":"Insider threat"},{"tag":"LSTM"},{"tag":"Stacked ensemble"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/DKDKA49S","itemID":1471,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493921,"version":0},"$loki":1324},{"itemID":507,"item":{"key":"DP5PIU9M","version":5498,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain and strain localization behavior of granular materials","abstractNote":"This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain and strain localization behavior of granular materials using the discrete element method. The study used the Particle Flow Code (PFC) to simulate biaxial compression tests in granular materials. To study the effects of rolling resistance, a user-deﬁned rolling resistance model was implemented in PFC. A series of parametric studies was performed to investigate the effects of different levels of rolling resistance on the stress–strain response and the emergence and development of shear bands in granular materials. The PFC models were also tested under a range of macro-mechanical parameters and boundary conditions. It is shown that rolling resistance affects the elastic, shear strength and dilation response of granular materials, and new relationships between rolling resistance and macroscopic elasticity, shear strength and dilation parameters are presented. It is also concluded that the rolling resistance has significant effects on the orientation, thickness and the timing of the occurrence of shear bands. The results reinforce prior conclusions by Oda et al. (Mech Mater 1:269–283, 1982) on the importance of rolling resistance in promoting shear band formation in granular materials. It is shown that increased rolling resistance results in the development of columns of particles in granular materials during strain hardening process. The buckling of these columns of particles in narrow zones then leads to the development of shear bands. High gradients of particle rotation and large voids are produced within the shear band as a result of the buckling of the columns.","date":"10/2010","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10035-010-0211-x","accessDate":"2022-11-20T11:53:56Z","extra":"Citation Key: mohamed2010comprehensive","volume":"12","pages":"527-541","publicationTitle":"Granular Matter","DOI":"10.1007/s10035-010-0211-x","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Granular Matter","ISSN":"1434-5021, 1434-7636","creators":[{"firstName":"Abdalsalam","lastName":"Mohamed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marte","lastName":"Gutierrez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"arrester bed PFC模拟"}],"collections":["RLN987UH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-20T11:53:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/DP5PIU9M","itemID":507,"attachments":[{"key":"25UPXFLQ","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2010-Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain.pdf","parentItem":"DP5PIU9M","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2010-Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/1\">Abstract</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/2\">2 Methodology</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/2\">2.1 DEM overview</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/3\">2.2 Implementation of rolling resistance in DEM</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/4\">2.3 DEM modeling</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/6\">3 Results and discussion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/6\">3.1 Effects of rolling resistance on elastic behavior</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/7\">3.2 Effects of rolling resistance on shear strength and dilatancy</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/9\">3.3 Effects of rolling resistance on onset of shear band formation</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/9\">3.4 Effect of rolling resistance on shear band orientation</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/10\">3.5 Effect of rolling resistance on shear band thickness</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/11\">3.6 Micromechanical observations</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/13\">4 Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8FY779US/14\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-20T11:54:25Z","dateModified":"2022-11-20T11:54:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/25UPXFLQ","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\25UPXFLQ\\2010-Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1134/2010-Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493927,"version":0},"$loki":1325},{"itemID":229,"item":{"key":"DUQ9S5DV","version":5494,"itemType":"preprint","title":"Higher order information volume of mass function","abstractNote":"For a certain moment, the information volume represented in a probability space can be accurately measured by Shannon entropy. But in real life, the results of things usually change over time, and the prediction of the information volume contained in the future is still an open question. Deng entropy proposed by Deng in recent years is widely applied on measuring the uncertainty, but its physical explanation is controversial. In this paper, we give Deng entropy a new explanation based on the fractal idea, and proposed its generalization called time fractal-based (TFB) entropy. The TFB entropy is recognized as predicting the uncertainty over a period of time by splitting times, and its maximum value, called higher order information volume of mass function (HOIVMF), can express more uncertain information than all of existing methods.","date":"2020-12-14","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07507","accessDate":"2022-11-04T07:19:03Z","extra":"arXiv:2012.07507 [cs, math]\nCitation Key: zhou2020higher","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:2012.07507","citationKey":"Zhou2020","creators":[{"firstName":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Information Theory","type":1},{"tag":"Mathematics - Probability","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NE7GJ2G4"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T07:19:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/DUQ9S5DV","itemID":229,"attachments":[{"key":"99L4V8JQ","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhou2020.md","parentItem":"DUQ9S5DV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhou2020.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:19:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-04T08:19:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/99L4V8JQ","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\99L4V8JQ\\@Zhou2020.md","defaultPath":"files/1080/@Zhou2020.md"},{"key":"KQZ9UFSB","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2020-Higher order information volume of mass function.pdf","parentItem":"DUQ9S5DV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2020-Higher order information volume of mass function.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

However, traditional model-free methods suffer from the expensive computational cost of evaluating networks; almost all the research on Bayesian optimization is aimed at optimizing the objective functions with vectorial inputs, e.g., the hyper-parameters in any expert systems. This work focuses on applying Bayesian optimization to optimize network structure with graph-structured inputs, and presents a flexible framework, denoted as graph Bayesian optimization (GBO), to handle arbitrary graphs. By combining the proposed framework with graph kernels, it can take full advantage of implicit graph structural features to supplement explicit features guessed according to the experience, such as tags of nodes and any attributes of graphs. Simultaneously, the proposed framework can identify which features are more important during the optimization process. By collaboratively working with a down-stream decision tree, the GBO can not only find the optimum but also discover its knowledge represented by rules, which can further enhance its interpretability and assist expert decision-making. A novel problem of opening the gated residential areas is presented in this work, which can serve as one benchmark task of road network design. Intensive experiments conducted on three real-world applications, including robust network design, the most active node identification, and urban transportation network design, demonstrate its efficacy and potential applications.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420311684","extra":"Citation Key: cui2021novel","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"170","pages":"114524","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114524","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiaxu","lastName":"Cui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Tan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chunxu","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesian optimization"},{"tag":"Graph kernels"},{"tag":"Graphs"},{"tag":"Networks"},{"tag":"Structure optimization"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/E5RF967F","itemID":1410,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493941,"version":0},"$loki":1328},{"itemID":27,"item":{"key":"E7PZCYT7","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A new distance between two bodies of evidence","abstractNote":"We present a measure of performance (MOP) for identi®cation algorithms based on the evidential theory of Dempster±Shafer.

modeling approach for interpretable inference and prediction with data for sepsis diagnosis","abstractNote":"Sepsis is a serious disease that can cause death. It is important to predict sepsis within the early stages after the presence of sepsis symptoms. In this paper, a new probabilistic modeling approach is used to establish classifiers for sepsis diagnosis. This approach is characterized by unique strong interpretability, which is reflected in three aspects: (1) evidence acquisition based on likelihood analysis, (2) probabilistic rule-based inference, and (3) parameters optimization using machine learning algorithms. Four-fold cross-validation is used to train and validate classifiers established by the new approach and alternative ones. Results show that in terms of classification capability, the classifier established by the new approach generally performs better than the majority of alternative classifiers for sepsis diagnosis, and close to the best one. As the classifier also features an inherent interpretability, it can be used as a tool for supporting diagnostic decision-making in sepsis diagnosis.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421007624","extra":"Citation Key: yao2021probabilistic","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"183","pages":"115333","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115333","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shuaiyu","lastName":"Yao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong-Ling","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Dark","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Interpretability"},{"tag":"Maximum likelihood evidential reasoning framework"},{"tag":"Probabilistic modeling"},{"tag":"Rule-based inference"},{"tag":"Sepsis diagnosis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/EK7ZX4BD","itemID":1426,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493963,"version":0},"$loki":1332},{"itemID":353,"item":{"key":"ELNC8NS6","version":5495,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Critique of modified Deng entropies under the evidence theory","abstractNote":"The Evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) has been frequently used in practical applications to deal with uncertainty or lack of information. It is based on the concept of basic probability assignment (BPA). In DST, it is important to quantify the uncertainty (or information) that a BPA represents. An uncertainty measure, known as Deng entropy, was introduced as an interesting alternative to other measures proposed before. In previous work, it was shown that the Deng entropy does not verify most of the required properties for this type of measure and presents some undesirable behaviors. Two modifications of the Deng entropy have been recently proposed, which improve the original one. In this research, we demonstrate that these modifications do also not satisfy the majority of the necessary mathematical properties, and they present most of the behavioral drawbacks of the original one. Therefore, as the original Deng entropy, the modified ones should be cautiously employed in practical applications.","date":"2020-11-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920305099","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:16:24Z","extra":"Citation Key: moral-garcia2020critique","volume":"140","pages":"110112","publicationTitle":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110112","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","ISSN":"0960-0779","creators":[{"firstName":"Serafín","lastName":"Moral-García","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Deng entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Non-specificity","type":1},{"tag":"Conflict","type":1},{"tag":"Evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"Modified Deng entropies","type":1},{"tag":"Uncertainty measures","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:16:24Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ELNC8NS6","itemID":353,"attachments":[{"key":"B77WASE3","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Moral-Garcia2020.md","parentItem":"ELNC8NS6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Moral-Garcia2020.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:46:04Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:46:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/B77WASE3","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\B77WASE3\\@Moral-Garcia2020.md","defaultPath":"files/1132/@Moral-Garcia2020.md"},{"key":"JSEQQTZL","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2020-Critique of modified Deng entropies under the evidence theory.pdf","parentItem":"ELNC8NS6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2020-Critique of modified Deng entropies under the evidence theory.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/2\">2 Background</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/2\">2.1 Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/2\">2.2 Uncertainty measures in DST</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/3\">2.3 Required properties of uncertainty measures in DST</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/3\">3 Properties of the modified Deng entropies</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/5\">4 Some undesirable behaviors of the modified Deng entropies</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/5\">5 Conclusions and future work</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/5\">Declaration of Competing Interest</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_8MIHG8RL/5\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:16:27Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:16:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JSEQQTZL","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\JSEQQTZL\\2020-Critique of modified Deng entropies under the evidence theory.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1133/2020-Critique of modified Deng entropies under the evidence theory.pdf"},{"key":"IWPJ584E","version":6031,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920305099","accessDate":"2022-11-05T01:16:38Z","parentItem":"ELNC8NS6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0960077920305099.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:16:38Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:16:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IWPJ584E","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\IWPJ584E\\S0960077920305099.html","defaultPath":"files/356/S0960077920305099.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493971,"version":0},"$loki":1333},{"itemID":687,"item":{"key":"EM44BA8G","version":5501,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Thermally induced two-phase oscillating flow inside a capillary tube","abstractNote":"This paper deals with thermally induced meniscus oscillations in a two-phase system consisting of a liquid plug and a vapor bubble in a capillary tube of circular cross-section.

A visualization experiment is performed and the oscillations of the liquid–vapor meniscus and the vapor pressure are observed. We propose next a theoretical model.

Local hydrodynamic characteristics such as velocities, lengths, shapes and profiles of bubbles and slugs, their dynamic contact angles, thickness of the liquid film that surrounds the bubbles, enhanced mixing/ flow circulation within the liquid slugs and net pressure drop along the flow, etc., are needed to predict local heat transfer and thus, the global thermal performance. In this paper, we systematically review the experimental, theoretical/analytical, and modeling methodologies to predict these hydrodynamic properties in unidirectional two-phase Taylor bubble flows, in the context of Pulsating Heat Pipes. Indeed, there is little literature available for oscillating Taylor bubbles flows.

The present work is devoted to the investigation of three new fusion schemes for the remaining useful life forecast. These integrated frameworks are based on aggregating a set of Gaussian process regression models thanks to the Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging Operators. The combination procedure is built upon three proposed analytical weighting schemes including exponential, logarithmic and inverse functions. In addition, the uncertainty aspect is supported in this work, where the proposed functions are used to weighted average the variances released from competitive Gaussian process regression models. The training data are transformed into gradient values, which are adopted as new training data instead of the original observations. A lithium-ion battery data set is used as a benchmark to prove the efficiency of the proposed weighting schemes. The obtained results are promising and may provide some guidelines for future advances in performing robust fusion options to accurately estimate the remaining useful life.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421014263","extra":"Citation Key: bouzenita2022new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"189","pages":"116091","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116091","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Bouzenita","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leïla-Hayet","lastName":"Mouss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Melgani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Toufik","lastName":"Bentrcia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Analytical weighting function"},{"tag":"Fusion"},{"tag":"Gaussian process"},{"tag":"Induced ordered weighted averaging"},{"tag":"Remaining useful life"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/F6A6DD3Z","itemID":1430,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493992,"version":0},"$loki":1338},{"itemID":413,"item":{"key":"FBBKCW5P","version":5496,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Information quality evaluation in fusion systems","abstractNote":"Advances in new information and communication technology have considerably increased the quantity of available data and permitted the implementation of more and more complex processing techniques. As a result of these changes it appeared the need of evaluating the information fusion system quality and to propose to the user the information accompanied with conﬁdence coefﬁcients. The information fusion systems used nowadays are complex systems that are difﬁcult to be evaluated. To overcome this problem we propose a new quality evaluation methodology based on the decomposition of the information fusion system in its elementary modules that allows the evaluation of the quality at two levels. The ﬁrst one (global) that describes the entire information fusion system and the second one (local) for each elementary module. As data and information change over time, this decomposition allows to directly evaluate the global quality of the information fusion system using the local quality evaluation.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","extra":"Citation Key: todoraninformation","pages":"8","creators":[{"firstName":"Ion-George","lastName":"Todoran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Lecornu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Khenchaf","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean-Marc Le","lastName":"Caillec","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/J8RNVTKA"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-14T14:19:29Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FBBKCW5P","itemID":413,"attachments":[{"key":"JNRQ29GD","version":6036,"itemType":"attachment","title":"-Information quality evaluation in fusion systems.pdf","parentItem":"FBBKCW5P","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"-Information quality evaluation in fusion systems.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/U4YQKMMF"]},"dateAdded":"2022-12-27T14:42:22Z","dateModified":"2022-12-27T14:42:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JNRQ29GD","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\JNRQ29GD\\-Information quality evaluation in fusion systems.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1096/-Information quality evaluation in fusion systems.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117493997,"version":0},"$loki":1339},{"itemID":1524,"item":{"key":"FBJQ7C2H","version":5677,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"企业营销道德建设对顾客忠诚度的影响","abstractNote":"企业营销道德建设就是企业以道德营销为指导原则,在营销过程中,不将完成营销业绩作为最高目标,而将消费者福利、社会福利等与企业利益联系在一起的道德建设行为。这种行为有助于提高顾客满意度,增强顾客对企业的情感承诺,促进行为忠诚和态度忠诚。","date":"2014","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=33&recid=&FileName=JGZK201404015&DbName=CJFD2014&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:23:00Z","extra":"Citation Key: li2014qi","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"31","pages":"58-60","publicationTitle":"晋中学院学报","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"晋中学院学报","ISSN":"1673-1808","creators":[{"name":"李吉艳","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"道德营销","type":1},{"tag":"顾客忠诚度","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:23:04Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FBJQ7C2H","itemID":1524,"attachments":[{"key":"AHDVGYKK","version":6053,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2014-企业营销道德建设对顾客忠诚度的影响.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lWIDuvt8DXx50qx6%2b9GkkkDwURBIovEZWsxpaJNu72RsmHgiO0UtQt9x07MuJvq%2bx0tqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSEi%2bjZm9S052X5OlRezJDSV6opkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:23:13Z","parentItem":"FBJQ7C2H","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2014-企业营销道德建设对顾客忠诚度的影响.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:23:13Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:23:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/AHDVGYKK","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\AHDVGYKK\\2014-企业营销道德建设对顾客忠诚度的影响.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1529/2014-企业营销道德建设对顾客忠诚度的影响.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494003,"version":0},"$loki":1340},{"itemID":1476,"item":{"key":"FBUMYTAQ","version":5517,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The power of ensemble learning in sentiment analysis","abstractNote":"An ensemble of models is a set of learning models whose individual predictions are combined in such a way that component models compensate for each other’s weaknesses. Although there has been a growing interest in ensemble learning techniques in the general machine learning community, the use of ensembles in sentiment classification is still limited. Moreover, much of the research activity on ensemble learning is centred around homogeneous ensembles, although heterogeneous ensembles may prove very useful when combining pre-trained models, which are often readily available. In this paper, several techniques for constructing heterogeneous ensembles are applied and comparatively evaluated in respect of benchmark sentiment classification data sets across four different domains. Median performance improvements of up to 5.53% over the best individual model are observed for several ensemble configurations in respect of all four validation data sets, and clear trends are identified that may prove useful to other researchers in the field. Furthermore, a novel ensemble selection approach is proposed that avoids the storage of individual predictions, as well as the costly retraining of all candidate models for an ensemble, that are often required by other similar approaches.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421011854","extra":"Citation Key: kazmaier2022power","volume":"187","pages":"115819","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115819","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Jacqueline","lastName":"Kazmaier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan H.","lastName":"van Vuuren","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Sentiment analysis"},{"tag":"Ensemble learning"},{"tag":"Natural language processing"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FBUMYTAQ","itemID":1476,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494007,"version":0},"$loki":1341},{"itemID":1645,"item":{"key":"FCL8K6JA","version":5840,"itemType":"document","title":"Target to pay $18.5M for 2013 data breach that affected 41 million consumers","date":"May 23, 2017","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/23/target-pay-185m-2013-data-breach-affected-consumers/102063932/","accessDate":"2023-04-30","extra":"Citation Key: target\nType: EB/OL\ntex.entrytype: digital","creators":[{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"McCoy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-30T13:37:11Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T13:37:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FCL8K6JA","itemID":1645,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494010,"version":0},"$loki":1342},{"itemID":1220,"item":{"key":"FJCZ6M9R","version":5504,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION BASED ON POSSIBILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","date":"12/1982","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术4区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：理论方法3区","callNumber":"2.4348","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03081078208960799","accessDate":"2023-03-24T15:09:47Z","rights":"2.0878","extra":"Citation Key: higashi1982measures","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"9","pages":"43-58","publicationTitle":"International Journal of General Systems","DOI":"10.1080/03081078208960799","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Gen Syst","ISSN":"0308-1079, 1563-5104","creators":[{"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Higashi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George J.","lastName":"Klir","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:09:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FJCZ6M9R","itemID":1220,"attachments":[{"key":"SDRHIARH","version":6047,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Higashi 和 Klir - 1982 - MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION BASED ON P.pdf","parentItem":"FJCZ6M9R","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Higashi 和 Klir - 1982 - MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION BASED ON P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:09:41Z","dateModified":"2023-03-24T15:09:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/SDRHIARH","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\SDRHIARH\\Higashi 和 Klir - 1982 - MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION BASED ON P.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1219/Higashi 和 Klir - 1982 - MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION BASED ON P.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494050,"version":0},"$loki":1343},{"itemID":83,"item":{"key":"FVHUE3YD","version":5493,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Entropic Explanation of Power Set","abstractNote":"A power set of a set S is deﬁned as the set of all subsets of S, including set S itself and empty set, denoted as P (S) or 2S. Given a ﬁnite set S with |S|= n hypothesis, one property of power set is that the amount of subsets of S is |P (S)|= 2n. However, the physica meaning of power set needs exploration. To address this issue, a possible explanation of power set is proposed in this paper. A power set of n events can be seen as all possible k-combination, where k ranges from 0 to n. It means the power set extends the event space in probability theory into all possible combination of the single basic event. From the view of power set, all subsets or all combination of basic events, are created equal. These subsets are assigned with the mass function, whose uncertainty can be measured by Deng entropy. The relationship between combinatorial number, Pascal’s triangle and power set is revealed by Deng entropy quantitively from the view of information measure.","date":"2021-08-13","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/4413","accessDate":"2022-09-28T14:02:17Z","extra":"Citation Key: song2021entropic","volume":"16","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2021.4.4413","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

Currently, the existed uncertainty measures in the DST framework are limited to the closed world where the frame of discernment (FOD) is assumed to be complete. To address this issue, this paper focuses on extending a belief entropy to the open world by considering the uncertain information represented as the FOD and the nonzero mass function of the empty set simultaneously. An extension to Deng’s entropy in the open world assumption (EDEOW) is proposed as a generalization of the Deng’s entropy and it can be degenerated to the Deng entropy in the closed world wherever necessary. In order to test the reasonability and effectiveness of the extended belief entropy, an EDEOW-based information fusion approach is proposed and applied to sensor data fusion under uncertainty circumstance. The experimental results verify the usefulness and applicability of the extended measure as well as the modified sensor data fusion method. In addition, a few open issues still exist in the current work: the necessary properties for a belief entropy in the open world assumption, whether there exists a belief entropy that satisfies all the existed properties, and what is the most proper fusion frame for sensor data fusion under uncertainty.","date":"2018/6","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"分析化学3区  工程：电子与电气3区  仪器仪表3区","callNumber":"3.8470","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/6/1902","accessDate":"2023-03-24T14:00:55Z","rights":"4.0501","extra":"Number: 6\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute\nCitation Key: tang2018extension","seriesTitle":"自然科学A","volume":"18","pages":"1902","publicationTitle":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s18061902","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Sensors-basel","ISSN":"1424-8220","creators":[{"firstName":"Yongchuan","lastName":"Tang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix T.

This approach offers substantial compu­ tational benefits at the price of increased calibration complexity. This work proposes a method to simplify calibration of rolling resistance. The key element is an empirical relation between a contact parameter (rolling friction) and a 3D grain shape descriptor (true sphericity). Values of true sphericity can be obtained by image analysis of the grains, either directly by 3D acquisition or by correlation with simpler-to-obtain 2D shape measures. Evaluation of rolling friction is thus made independent from that of other model parameters. As an extra benefit, the variability of grain shape in natural sands can be directly mapped into the discrete model. A mapping between rolling friction and true sphericity is calibrated using specimen-scale and grain scale results from two triaxial compression tests on Hostun sand and Caicos ooids. The mapping is validated using different triaxial tests from the same sands and from other reference sands (Ottawa, Ticino). In the case of Ticino grainshape acquisition is made in 2D, using an ordinary table scanner. The results obtained support this direct cali­ bration procedure.","date":"03/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0266352X20304924","accessDate":"2022-11-22T03:47:49Z","extra":"Citation Key: rorato2021imagebased","volume":"131","pages":"103929","publicationTitle":"Computers and Geotechnics","DOI":"10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103929","journalAbbreviation":"Computers and Geotechnics","ISSN":"0266352X","creators":[{"firstName":"R.","lastName":"Rorato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Arroyo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Gens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E.","lastName":"Andò","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Viggiani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RLN987UH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T03:47:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/G2XZU8HP","itemID":521,"attachments":[{"key":"Y7P2KGVK","version":6037,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Image-based calibration of rolling resistance in discrete element models of sand.pdf","parentItem":"G2XZU8HP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Image-based calibration of rolling resistance in discrete element models of sand.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Despite ongoing efforts to reduce these workplace accidents, they remain as a serious problem. Therefore, understanding the relationship between the contributing factors to workplace accidents in micro-enterprises remains a key area of interest for safety professionals. Method This paper presents a new integrated approach comprised of a D number Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (D-DEMATEL) technique, and an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (IFISM) technique. The DEMATEL technique is applied to determine the cause-and-effect relationships of contributing factors, and D number theory is applied to take into account their uncertain characteristics. Lastly the IFISM technique is used to examine the hierarchical structure of driver-driven relationships. Results Results showed that sixteen factors contribute to the micro-enterprises’ workplace accidents in which “repairing or maintaining equipment under unsafe conditions” and “improper use of tools” are the most important causes. The hierarchal structure analysis showed that the root and basic causes of micro-enterprises’ workplace accidents based on the ISM method were the “improper use of tools” and “repairing or maintaining equipment under unsafe conditions”. Conclusions This study is the first of its kind to propose a hybrid D-DEMATEL–IFISM method for identifying and evaluating the contributing factors affecting the occurrence of workplace accidents in micro-enterprises. The new method allows insights on contributing factors to be based not only importance, intensity and impact of each identified contributing factor but also on the relationship amongst the contributing factors. Practical application The study presents key information on the main contributing factors to micro enterprise workplace accidents. These results provide safety professionals with evidence which can be used to focus safety efforts, with a view to reducing workplace accidents in micro enterprises.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422004730","extra":"Citation Key: khorasane2022identifying","volume":"200","pages":"117059","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117059","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Maryam Amiri","lastName":"Khorasane","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Alimohammadlou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Klockner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Kamalinia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Jahangiri","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"D-DEMATEL"},{"tag":"IF-ISM"},{"tag":"Influential factor"},{"tag":"Micro-enterprises"},{"tag":"Workplace accident"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GEN3E6QA","itemID":1444,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494089,"version":0},"$loki":1349},{"itemID":940,"item":{"key":"GFSEGAK8","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1-3.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1-3.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:11:10Z","dateModified":"2023-03-15T07:11:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GFSEGAK8","itemID":940,"localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\GFSEGAK8\\1-3.pdf","defaultPath":"files/940/1-3.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494093,"version":0},"$loki":1350},{"itemID":1517,"item":{"key":"GIAAX3QE","version":5677,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"基于社会责任的企业营销道德分析","abstractNote":"企业营销道德是用来判断企业营销活动正确与否的道德标准。企业在生存和发展中应该承担社会责任。企业不遵守营销道德标准就很难履行其社会责任,而不履行社会责任的企业又必然违背了营销道德标准。中国企业的营销道德水准和社会责任感比较缺乏,直接影响了中国企业国内国际的竞争力。因此,应基于社会责任提高企业的营销道德水准,以促进企业和社会的良性发展。","date":"2013","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=24&recid=&FileName=JJYD201307093&DbName=CJFD2013&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:53Z","extra":"Citation Key: guo2013ji","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"214-215","publicationTitle":"经济研究导刊","issue":"7","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"经济研究导刊","ISSN":"1673-291X","creators":[{"name":"郭洁","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"周秀兰","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"诚信","type":1},{"tag":"道德营销","type":1},{"tag":"社会责任","type":1},{"tag":"责任营销","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:53Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GIAAX3QE","itemID":1517,"attachments":[{"key":"25J6WKV9","version":6054,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2013-基于社会责任的企业营销道德分析.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lWGGByp5K9x%2bm5xSinRv0rc8mhTy5cuXD70QZlrQCmNWzeVu5Rs5wkJzzPB%2bz1dhj8tqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSEVewxPGeZS35uhJGp%2fTbjyqopkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:58Z","parentItem":"GIAAX3QE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2013-基于社会责任的企业营销道德分析.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:58Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:23:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/25J6WKV9","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\25J6WKV9\\2013-基于社会责任的企业营销道德分析.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1521/2013-基于社会责任的企业营销道德分析.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494097,"version":0},"$loki":1351},{"itemID":464,"item":{"key":"GKBRCHZY","version":5497,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Mixed convection with flow reversal in the thermal entrance region of horizontal and vertical pipes -

The URREF ontology defines self-confidence as a measure of the information credibility as evaluated by the sensor itself. The concept of confidence, which is not explicitly defined in the ontology at URREF, has been extensively explored in the literature about evaluation in information fusion systems (IFS). In this paper, we provide a discussion on confidence as it relates to the evaluation of IFS, and compare it with the existing concepts in the URREF ontology. Our goal is two-fold, since we address both the distinctions between confidence and self-confidence, as well as the implications of these differences when evaluating the impact of uncertainty to the decision-making processes supported byt the IFS. We illustrate the discussion with an example of decision making that involves signal detection theory, confusion matrix fusion, subjective logic, and proportional conflict redistribution. We argue that uncertainty can be minimized through confidence (information evidence) and self-confidence (source agent) processing, The results here seek to enrich the ongoing discussion at the ISIF's Evaluation of Techniques for Uncertainty Representation Working Group (ETURWG) on self-confidence and trust in information fusion systems design.","date":"2014-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Citation Key: blasch2014urref","pages":"1-8","proceedingsTitle":"17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","conferenceName":"17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","creators":[{"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Blasch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Audun","lastName":"Jøsang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Dezert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paulo C.

In this study, it was paid attention for considering real constraints of firms such as capital, time etc. to prevent nan-fatal failure modes (FMs), interactions between FMs and risk level similarities created by risk factors (RFs). At the first stage of the proposed approach, RFs’ weights are computed by a new intuitionistic fuzzy weighting method considering similarities between RFs for risk levels that they can create. At the second stage, Modified Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi Attribute Border Approximation Area (MIF-MABAC) including interactions between FMs is used to determine the rankings of FMs by using Extended Haussdorff distance function. At the third stage, two intuitionistic fuzzy mathematical models are established to show the effect of the real constraints of the firm to identify the risk types (RTs) that must be avoided primarily. It was seen that the first model gives the same ranking results with the MIF-MABAC. Additionally, when including the real constraints, the first model can give the more suitable results than the second model.

[2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327–337; Bartels and Zeki [2000]: Neuroreport 11:3829–3834; Ortigue et al. [2007]: J Cogn Neurosci 19:1218–1230), revealing activation in the reward and motivation systems of the brain. In this study, we asked what systems are activated for early-stage romantic love in Easterners, speciﬁcally Chinese participants? Are these activations affected by individual differences within a cultural context of Traditionality and Modernity? Also, are these brain activations correlated with later satisfaction in the relationship? In Beijing, we used the same procedure used by Aron et al. (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327–337). The stimuli for 18 Chinese participants were a picture of the face of their beloved, the face of a familiar acquaintance, and a countback task. We found significant activations speciﬁc to the beloved in the reward and motivation systems, particularly, the ventral tegmental area and the caudate. The mid-orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum were also activated, whereas amygdala, medial orbitofrontal, and medial accumbens activity were decreased relative to the familiar acquaintance. Self-reported Traditionality and Modernity scores were each positively correlated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, although in different regions and sides of the brain. Activity in the subgenual area and the superior frontal gyrus was associated with higher relationship happiness at 18-month follow-up. Our results show that midbrain dopamine-rich reward/motivation systems were activated by early-stage romantic love in Chinese participants, as found by other studies. Neural activity was associated with Traditionality and Modernity attitudes as well as with later relationship happiness for Chinese participants. Hum Brain Mapp 32:249–257, 2011.

In sensor networks, in collaborative health or genomic projects, in credit risk analysis, among other domains, distinct features are collected from multiple sources, including the use of social media and mobile applications, and due to privacy concerns or communication costs, may not be shared among sites. This scenario of vertical data partitioning poses challenges to traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, as classical algorithms are designed to learn from the complete set of features. A common strategy is to combine predictions from local models trained at each site into a global model, and for this purpose, several aggregation methods have been proposed. In this work we tackle a gap within the related literature, performing a comparative evaluation of elementary and meta-learning-based aggregation methods to reveal their strengths and weakness for 46 datasets with varied characteristics. We show that no method outperforms its counterparts in all domains, emphasizing the need for experimental comparison to ensure a good choice in the domain of interest. Moreover, our experiments provide the first insights into the relations between datasets’ properties and aggregators’ performance. We show that for low class imbalance and a good instance-to-feature ratio, almost all aggregation methods tend to perform well. The silhouette coefficient (reflecting class separability) and class imbalance coefficient are the most influential properties on aggregators’ performance, thus we recommend their analysis in the first step of the methodological design. We found that arithmetic-based methods are not suitable for datasets with poor class separability and a large number of classes, whereas meta-learning approaches are less sensitive for datasets with silhouette coefficient close to 0. Our analyses were summarized as classification and regression trees, which have the impact to serve as practical tools for future research. Taken together, our findings give rise to interesting applications in the domain of intelligent systems, especially regarding their potential to reduce the burden of vast experimental comparisons when training ML models with feature-partitioned data.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742030230X","extra":"Citation Key: trevizan2020comparative","volume":"152","pages":"113406","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113406","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Bernardo","lastName":"Trevizan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Chamby-Diaz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ana L.C.","lastName":"Bazzan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Recamonde-Mendoza","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Attribute-partitioned data"},{"tag":"Distributed machine learning"},{"tag":"Predictions aggregation"},{"tag":"Vertical data partitioning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/H87K3C5R","itemID":1456,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494143,"version":0},"$loki":1359},{"itemID":1006,"item":{"key":"H93PDAZU","version":5503,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Air-light estimation using haze-lines","abstractNote":"Outdoor images taken in bad weather conditions, such as haze and fog, look faded and have reduced contrast. Recently there has been great success in single image dehazing, i.e., improving the visibility and restoring the colors from a single image. A crucial step in these methods is the calculation of the air-light color, the color of an area of the image with no objects in line-of-sight. We propose a new method for calculating the air-light. The method relies on the haze-lines prior that was recently introduced. This prior is based on the observation that the pixel values of a hazy image can be modeled as lines in RGB space that intersect at the air-light. We use Hough transform in RGB space to vote for the location of the air-light. We evaluate the proposed method on an existing dataset of real world images, as well as some synthetic and other real images. Our method performs on-par with current state-of-the-art techniques and is more computationally efﬁcient.","date":"5/2017","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7951489/","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:29:36Z","extra":"Citation Key: berman2017airlight","place":"Stanford, CA, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-5090-5745-0","pages":"1-9","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","DOI":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2017.7951489","creators":[{"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Berman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Treibitz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shai","lastName":"Avidan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"air-light calculation"},{"tag":"haze-lines prior"},{"tag":"single image dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:29:36Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/H93PDAZU","itemID":1006,"attachments":[{"key":"VY6CSJM3","version":6046,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2017-Air-light estimation using haze-lines.pdf","parentItem":"H93PDAZU","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017-Air-light estimation using haze-lines.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:31:16Z","dateModified":"2023-03-21T02:31:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/VY6CSJM3","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\VY6CSJM3\\2017-Air-light estimation using haze-lines.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1196/2017-Air-light estimation using haze-lines.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494148,"version":0},"$loki":1360},{"itemID":187,"item":{"key":"HJWEWNHP","version":5494,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Kawaii emotions in presentations: Viewing a physical touch affects perception of affiliative feelings of others toward an object","abstractNote":"We investigated how a presenter’s touching behaviors of an object during its explanation affect the observer’s perceived feelings of\n              kawaii\n              , a Japanese word that means “cute,” toward the object and the presenter. We conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter as well as a web survey experiment with both robot and human presenters. Based on the phenomenon that people more firmly touch an object when their perceived\n              kawaii\n              feeling is overwhelmingly strong, we investigated the effects of touching behavior with emphasized styles. First, we conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter where participants observed their presentations about an object to explain its characteristics. The results showed that participants who observed the robot’s touch behaviors perceived the object to be more\n              kawaii\n              and thought that the robot also felt the object was more\n              kawaii\n              . On the other hand, the results did not effectively show any increase in the participant’s feelings of\n              kawaii\n              toward the robot or the emphasized touch style. Based on these results, we next conducted a web survey experiment to investigate whether such knowledge about touching effects is applicable for human presenters. The results resembled those obtained when the presenter was a robot, i.e., viewing a touch behavior increased both the presenter’s perceived feelings of\n              kawaii\n              toward the object and the participant’s feelings of\n              kawaii\n              toward it.

The problem of selecting the best fusion method for a given data set is an important but difficult task. For different data sets, different fusion methods work best, however, it is not possible to predict in advance which method will be appropriate for a given data set. In the proposed adaptive method, the weights assigned to the fusion methods are adjusted iteratively. The proposed method is based on empirically developed formulas. The results obtained using this method were compared with the results obtained from the online learning method — the Multiplicative Weights approach, which is asymptotically optimal (Arora, S., Hazan, E., & Kale, S., 2012). The multiplicative weights update method: a meta-algorithm and applications. Theory Comput., 8, 121–164). However, the results obtained with the use of the proposed method turns out to be better when applied to a finite set of test objects. In addition, a comparative analysis is provided when fusion methods are used simultaneously. Also, the results obtained when different fusion methods are used individually were compared. It was shown that the results obtained by the adaptive fusion method are much better.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423001021","extra":"Citation Key: przybyla-kasperek2023practically","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"219","pages":"119601","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119601","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Przybyła-Kasperek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Adaptive systems"},{"tag":"Dispersed data"},{"tag":"Fusion methods"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/HXJYLK6B","itemID":1425,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494185,"version":0},"$loki":1363},{"itemID":121,"item":{"key":"HZBS836K","version":5493,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Silver Ratio in Maximum Deng Entropy Triangle","abstractNote":"Pascal’s triangle is a mathematical triangular form of binomial coefﬁcients, from which Fibonacci number sequence and golden ratio can be obtained. Recently, the relations between Pascal’s triangle and maximum Deng entropy are studied and presented. A straightforward idea comes: if we design a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, what would the generated number sequence and the corresponding ratio be like? Hence, this paper proposes a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, named as the maximum Deng entropy triangle (MDET). Besides, the number sequences based on MDET are investigated. Next, the general term for the MDET sequence is presented and the ratio in MDET sequence is analyzed. We prove that, under the con√ dition of n → ∞, the ratio in right MDET sequence converges to silver ratio 1 + 2.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","extra":"Citation Key:

In most cases, the mass function can be translated into the probability, which is useful to expand the applications of the D-S evidence theory. However, how to reasonably transfer the mass function to the probability distribution is still an open issue. Hence, the paper proposed a new probability transform method based on the ordered weighted averaging and entropy diﬀerence. The new method calculates weights by ordered weighted averaging, and adds entropy diﬀerence as one of the measurement indicators. Then achieved the transformation of the minimum entropy diﬀerence by adjusting the parameter r of the weight function. Finally, some numerical examples are given to prove that new method is more reasonable and eﬀective.","date":"2020-06-08","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/3743","accessDate":"2023-03-23T01:31:15Z","extra":"Citation Key: pan2020probability","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2020.4.3743","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

First, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that emulates the decision-making ability of a botanist expert in the recognition of tree species from their leaves and bark. The main challenges of this recognition problem are related to the high diversity of trees in nature, the interspecies similarity and the intra-species variability. Therefore, similarities between species cause several confusions during recognition. The proposed decision system is designed to solve this complex problem of tree species recognition by reasoning with knowledge sets where the inference engine is based on belief functions theory, which reduces confusion between species and achieves greater accuracy. Secondly, this paper proposes a practical solution that can be embedded in the user's smartphone without any need for an internet connection. Therefore, our approach is adapted for smartphone limits, i.e. limits related to memory and computation capacity. Once in nature, everybody should appreciate the idea of having a mobile application that reflects the skills and know-how of a botanist. Building an application to make the potential of tree species recognition accessible and easy to use is a challenging problem. From methodological perspectives, the suggested method is a two-step recognition approach that identifies the leaf in a first step and refines the results using the bark in the second step. In fact, the first step is used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem through the identification of a subset of most probable species. The second step is performed using a modified evidential k Nearest Neighbors (EkNN) algorithm that recognizes the bark from the output of the first step. A set of experiments on real-world data is presented in order to study the accuracy of the proposed solution against existing ones.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419308711","extra":"Citation Key: jendoubi2020evidential","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"146","pages":"113154","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113154","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Siwar","lastName":"Jendoubi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Coquin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Reda","lastName":"Boukezzoula","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"k nearest neighbors"},{"tag":"Mass estimation"},{"tag":"Theory of belief functions"},{"tag":"Tree species recognition"},{"tag":"Two-step classification"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IJVF87DD","itemID":1434,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494230,"version":0},"$loki":1371},{"itemID":1516,"item":{"key":"IJVSCQIC","version":5677,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"基于营销道德的企业公共关系模式构建","abstractNote":"公共关系的形象价值、诚信价值、沟通价值以及创新价值在企业经营过程中发挥着无可替代的作用。企业在营销道德的约束下综合考虑全局利益制定、实施营销和公关战略,通过道德营销传播双向对称信息能有效的构建企业公共关系。从而为企业长期稳定的发展营造宽松的内外部环境。","date":"2011","language":"zh-CN","callNumber":"0.217","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=25&recid=&FileName=JZGC201133090&DbName=CJFD2011&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:51Z","rights":"0.084","extra":"Citation Key: liu2011ji","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"30","pages":"113-114","publicationTitle":"价值工程","DOI":"10.14018/j.cnki.cn13-1085/n.2011.33.224","issue":"33","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"价值工程","ISSN":"1006-4311","creators":[{"name":"刘晓娜","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"刘先涛","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"marketing ethics","type":1},{"tag":"公共关系","type":1},{"tag":"公众","type":1},{"tag":"public","type":1},{"tag":"public relations","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:51Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IJVSCQIC","itemID":1516,"attachments":[{"key":"KZJ8PUYF","version":6053,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2011-基于营销道德的企业公共关系模式构建.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lUF0%2flCwzFIM1vhwLpeum8Ii6rs8jJYzNSe4aGvHht4bTh5tKpfWQTHmJ4z2jnC60otqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSEV4wIt%2fRwgZE4QDx34BHHhaopkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:23:01Z","parentItem":"IJVSCQIC","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2011-基于营销道德的企业公共关系模式构建.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:23:01Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:23:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KZJ8PUYF","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\KZJ8PUYF\\2011-基于营销道德的企业公共关系模式构建.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1523/2011-基于营销道德的企业公共关系模式构建.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494235,"version":0},"$loki":1372},{"itemID":1343,"item":{"key":"IKIZ7AQN","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"On the plausibility transformation method for translating belief function models to probability models","date":"04/2006","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能4区","callNumber":"4.4522","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0888613X05000472","accessDate":"2023-04-02T02:57:09Z","rights":"3.5438","extra":"Citation Key: cobb2006plausibility","volume":"41","pages":"314-330","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijar.2005.06.008","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Approx Reason","ISSN":"0888613X","creators":[{"firstName":"Barry R.","lastName":"Cobb","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prakash P.","lastName":"Shenoy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-02T02:57:09Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IKIZ7AQN","itemID":1343,"attachments":[{"key":"LT6GF72M","version":6049,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cobb 和 Shenoy -

This paper presents an integrated approach of portfolio construction based on sector analysis for investment in National Stock Exchange of India. The model is developed in four stages: First, multiple evidences are collected using historical data to analyze the performance of different sectors, and ranked using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The top-ranked sectors are considered as the strong sectors. Second, Granger causality test is employed for determining interdependencies between the strong sectors using the past closing price time series. Then, the strong sectors with no causal relationships are selected to diversify the investment. Third, leading stocks of the selected sectors are picked on the basis on their performance in previous years. Thus, the portfolio of best stocks from strong and diverse sectors is constructed. Fourth, for optimizing of the constructed portfolio or to obtain optimal ratio allocations of stocks in the portfolio, an optimization function is constructed and simulated using a deep recurrent neural network. The results obtained by the proposed portfolio are found very significant which confirms its effectiveness. The applicability of the proposed model is verified by empirical study over the existing models.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422024538","extra":"Citation Key: bisht2023portfolio","volume":"215","pages":"119434","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119434","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Bisht","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Deep recurrent neural network"},{"tag":"Granger causality"},{"tag":"Portfolio construction"},{"tag":"Sector analysis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/INYTIQGI","itemID":1454,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494246,"version":0},"$loki":1374},{"itemID":1438,"item":{"key":"INZIA6VY","version":5513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Construction of partner selection criteria in sustainable supply chains: A systematic optimization model","abstractNote":"With the recent emphasis on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by both companies, consumers and governments, selecting eco-economic partners is more important than ever. Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach with a case study of a Chinese electronic and equipment manufacturer.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742030467X","extra":"Citation Key: wu2020construction","volume":"158","pages":"113643","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113643","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hubert","lastName":"Pun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chuanlin","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Criteria interrelationship analysis"},{"tag":"Genetic algorithm"},{"tag":"Partner selection"},{"tag":"Sustainable supply chain"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/INZIA6VY","itemID":1438,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494249,"version":0},"$loki":1375},{"itemID":1455,"item":{"key":"IP4F4HSX","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Recognize the surrounding: Development and evaluation of convolutional deep networks using gammatone spectrograms and raw audio signals","abstractNote":"Environmental sound (ES) consists of the surrounding sounds around us. The classification of this kind of sound has specific and significant contributions in many modern world applications, especially in the internet of things (IoT). However, accurately predicting the sound class of an ES is difficult because of the uncertain pattern in most cases. Although a lot of research has been done to develop a fully accurate environmental sound classification (ESC) system using different extracted features from signal, feature selection and classifier design is still a harsh job and sometimes does not guarantee a precise result. In recent years, ESC has attracted the attention of the research community because of the breakthrough in learning algorithms. Following this trend, a study is carried out here to find and propose two CNN models, 1D and 2D, for raw signal input and Gammatone spectrogram input, respectively. Compared with 2D CNN model, 1D CNN for time series waveform is a recent idea. Assessing the models on two various datasets (ESC-10 and US-8 K), the overall accuracy for 2D CNN is found 80.2% (ESC-10), 89% (US-8 K). For 1D CNN, the accuracy is 80.4% (ESC-10), 86% (US-8 K). The performance of the proposed 1D CNN model is almost similar to that of the proposed 2D CNN model. Effective data augmentation procedure is done to achieve this high accuracy by introducing variability in the given dataset, and to reduce overfitting. Finally, the proposed models have a minimal number of parameters to be trained, and floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) are also minimal, especially for 1D CNN.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422004171","extra":"Citation Key: sengupta2022recognize","volume":"200","pages":"116998","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116998","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Sen Gupta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shifat","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ki-Doo","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"CNN"},{"tag":"Environmental sound"},{"tag":"Gammatone"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IP4F4HSX","itemID":1455,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494252,"version":0},"$loki":1376},{"itemID":1449,"item":{"key":"IW6G455E","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Machine learning with Belief Rule-Based Expert Systems to predict stock price movements","abstractNote":"Price prediction of financial assets has been a key interest for researchers over the decades. Numerous techniques to predict the price movements have been developed by the researchers over the years. But a model loses its credibility once a large number of traders start using the same technique. Therefore, the traders are in continuous search of new and efficient prediction techniques. In this research, we propose a novel machine learning technique using technical analysis with Belief Rule-Based Expert System (BRBES), and incorporating the concept of Bollinger Band to forecast stock price in the next five days. A Bollinger Event is triggered when the closing price of the stock goes down the Lower Bollinger Band. The BRBES approach has never been applied to stock markets, despite its potential and the appetite of the financial markets for expert systems. We predict the price movement of the Swedish company TELIA as a proof of concept. The knowledge base of the initial BRBES is constructed by simulating the historical data and then the learning parameters are optimized using MATLAB’s fmincon function. We evaluate the performance of the trained BRBES in terms of Accuracy, Area Under ROC Curve, Root Mean Squared Error, type I error, type II error, R2 value, and profit/loss ratio. We compare our proposed model against a similar rule-based technique, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), to understand the significance of the improved rule base of BRBES. We also compare the performance against Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most popular machine learning techniques, and a simple heuristic model. Finally, the trained BRBES is compared against recent state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to show how competitive the performance of our proposed model is. The results show that the trained BRBES produces better performance than the non-trained BRBES, ANFIS, SVM, and the heuristic approaches. Also, it indicates better or competitive performance against the deep learning approaches. Thus BRBES exhibits its potential in predicting financial asset price movement.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422009940","extra":"Citation Key: hossain2022machine","volume":"206","pages":"117706","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117706","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Emam","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad Shahadat","lastName":"Hossain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pär-Ola","lastName":"Zander","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Andersson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Belief rule"},{"tag":"Bollinger band"},{"tag":"Expert system"},{"tag":"Stock prediction"},{"tag":"Time series analysis"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/IW6G455E","itemID":1449,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494255,"version":0},"$loki":1377},{"itemID":1419,"item":{"key":"J2F4YZ9X","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DPT: An importance-based decision probability transformation method for uncertain belief in evidence theory","abstractNote":"Dempster–Shafer evidence theory can combine multiple sources of uncertain information to form a consistent basic probability assignment (BPA).

In this method, the importance weight is introduced into the belief interval for the first time, and then the importance is used to define the information volume and superiority degree, so that more reliable decisions can be achieved through the trade-off between conservative and aggressive. Comparative experiments on numerical examples and applications show that the proposed DPT method can weigh the aggressiveness of decisions, and its decision probability transformation behavior is the most rational and its application performance is the most reliable.

The inconsistency between different frameworks causes limitations to existing measures. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, a new total uncertainty measure is proposed directly in the framework of belief functions theory without changing the theoretical frameworks.

Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-highdeﬁnition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The ﬁrst CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then ﬁts locallyafﬁne models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the highquality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks.","date":"6/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578433/","accessDate":"2023-03-30T08:04:23Z","extra":"Citation Key: zheng2021ultrahighdefinition","place":"Nashville, TN, USA","publisher":"IEEE","ISBN":"978-1-66544-509-2","pages":"16180-16189","proceedingsTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01592","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhuoran","lastName":"Zheng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenqi","lastName":"Ren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fenglong","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiuyi","lastName":"Jia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:24Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/K3LC4X62","itemID":1337,"attachments":[{"key":"5ZJA575N","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Ultra-High-Definition Image Dehazing via Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning.pdf","parentItem":"K3LC4X62","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Ultra-High-Definition Image Dehazing via Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-30T08:04:08Z","dateModified":"2023-03-30T08:05:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5ZJA575N","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\5ZJA575N\\2021-Ultra-High-Definition Image Dehazing via Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1333/2021-Ultra-High-Definition Image Dehazing via Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494299,"version":0},"$loki":1383},{"itemID":1257,"item":{"key":"KGCQ2EF4","version":5507,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II: A new measure of total uncertainty","abstractNote":"In Part I we discussed limitations of two measures of global (non-fuzzy) uncertainty of Lamata and Moral, and a measure of total (non-fuzzy) uncertainty due to Klir and Ramer and established the need for a new measure. In this paper we propose a set of intuitively desirable axioms for a measure of total uncertainty (TU) associated with a basic assignment m(A), and then derive an expression for a (unique) function that satisfies these requirements. Several theorems are proved about the new measure. Our measure is additive, and unlike other TU measures, has a unique maximum. The new measure reduces to Shannon's probabilistic entropy when the basic probability assignment focuses only on singletons. On the other hand, complete ignorance—basic assignment focusing only on the entire set, as a whole—reduces it to Hartley's measure of information. We show that the computational complexity of the new measure is O(N), whereas previous measures of TU are O(N2). Finally, we compare the new measure to its predecessors by extending the numerical example of Part I so that it includes values of the new measure.","date":"1993-01-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能4区","callNumber":"4.4522","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X05800039","accessDate":"2023-03-26T03:18:43Z","rights":"3.5438","extra":"Citation Key: pal1993uncertainty","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"8","pages":"1-16","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","DOI":"10.1016/S0888-613X(05)80003-9","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Approx Reason","ISSN":"0888-613X","creators":[{"firstName":"Nikhil R.","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James C.","lastName":"Bezdek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Hemasinha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Conflict","type":1},{"tag":"specificity","type":1},{"tag":"confusion","type":1},{"tag":"dissonance","type":1},{"tag":"entropy","type":1},{"tag":"evidential reasoning","type":1},{"tag":"uncertainty","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-26T03:18:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KGCQ2EF4","itemID":1257,"attachments":[{"key":"YN95RE2B","version":6047,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1993-Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II.pdf","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X05800039/pdf?md5=cf80631ccf3dba064872cb705a04cf69&pid=1-s2.0-S0888613X05800039-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y","accessDate":"2023-03-26T03:18:54Z","parentItem":"KGCQ2EF4","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1993-Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-26T03:18:54Z","dateModified":"2023-03-26T03:18:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YN95RE2B","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\YN95RE2B\\1993-Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1258/1993-Uncertainty measures for evidential reasoning II.pdf"},{"key":"FE8Q7IHF","version":6047,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X05800039","accessDate":"2023-03-26T03:18:54Z","parentItem":"KGCQ2EF4","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0888613X05800039.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-26T03:18:54Z","dateModified":"2023-03-26T03:18:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/FE8Q7IHF","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\FE8Q7IHF\\S0888613X05800039.html","defaultPath":"files/1259/S0888613X05800039.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494306,"version":0},"$loki":1384},{"itemID":1457,"item":{"key":"KIDXJPMN","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Novel weighted ensemble classifier for smartphone based indoor localization","abstractNote":"Indoor localization systems have the capability to change the way of providing location-based services in a closed environment. Though there is no agreed-upon technology that works best in indoor, WiFi signal is an important alternative as most of such places are covered by WiFi Access Points (APs). In this paper, the problem of indoor localization is investigated from the perspective of expert systems through applying machine learning techniques. The significant variation of WiFi signal strength with ambient conditions as well as device configuration badly affects the localization accuracy. Thus, the fingerprinting effort required to train a localization system subject to context heterogeneity is huge. The uncertainty in localization performance due to varying contexts is hardly investigated in the literature. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a weighted ensemble classifier based on Dempster–Shafer belief theory to efficiently handle context heterogeneity. Here, the context is defined in terms of different smartphone configurations used for training and testing the system as well as temporal variation of signals. The method presented here utilizes the Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions to calculate the weights of the base learners in the decision of the ensemble. Belief theory is applied here to handle the inherent uncertainty in WiFi signal variations due to heterogeneous context. Real life experiments are conducted for two datasets, JUIndoorLoc and UJIIndoorLoc at different granularity levels. For JUIndoorLoc, with state-of-the-art classifiers, 86–97% accuracy can be achieved for 10-fold cross-validation. However, when the training context differs from the test conditions, accuracy drops to 62–87%. In such a scenario, the proposed weighted ensemble technique is found to achieve almost 98% localization accuracy when RSSIs, mean and variance of RSSIs are considered as features. The technique can lead to an effective expert system for indoor localization at varying granularity levels. Such systems would be beneficial for pervasive indoor positioning applications as no dedicated infrastructure is needed for positioning.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420305820","extra":"Citation Key: roy2021novel","volume":"164","pages":"113758","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113758","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Priya","lastName":"Roy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chandreyee","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mausam","lastName":"Kundu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dip","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sanghamitra","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer belief theory"},{"tag":"Ensemble"},{"tag":"Indoor localization"},{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"RSSI"},{"tag":"WiFi"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KIDXJPMN","itemID":1457,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494310,"version":0},"$loki":1385},{"itemID":376,"item":{"key":"KN28TKVW","version":6063,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Power of Kawaii: Viewing Cute Images Promotes a Careful Behavior and Narrows Attentional Focus","abstractNote":"Kawaii (a Japanese word meaning ‘‘cute’’) things are popular because they produce positive feelings. However, their effect on behavior remains unclear. In this study, three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of viewing cute images on subsequent task performance. In the first experiment, university students performed a fine motor dexterity task before and after viewing images of baby or adult animals. Performance indexed by the number of successful trials increased after viewing cute images (puppies and kittens; M 6 SE = 43.9610.3% improvement) more than after viewing images that were less cute (dogs and cats; 11.965.5% improvement). In the second experiment, this finding was replicated by using a non-motor visual search task. Performance improved more after viewing cute images (15.762.2% improvement) than after viewing less cute images (1.462.1% improvement). Viewing images of pleasant foods was ineffective in improving performance (1.262.1%). In the third experiment, participants performed a global–local letter task after viewing images of baby animals, adult animals, and neutral objects. In general, global features were processed faster than local features. However, this global precedence effect was reduced after viewing cute images. Results show that participants performed tasks requiring focused attention more carefully after viewing cute images. This is interpreted as the result of a narrowed attentional focus induced by the cuteness-triggered positive emotion that is associated with approach motivation and the tendency toward systematic processing. For future applications, cute objects may be used as an emotion elicitor to induce careful behavioral tendencies in specific situations, such as driving and office work.","date":"2012-9-26","language":"en","shortTitle":"The Power of Kawaii","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046362","accessDate":"2022-11-05T09:31:30Z","extra":"Citation Key: nittono2012power","volume":"7","pages":"e46362","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0046362","issue":"9","journalAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","creators":[{"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nittono","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michiko","lastName":"Fukushima","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Yano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Moriya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Paterson","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["GSXRUD79"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/I83C8AUI"]},"dateAdded":"2022-10-30T15:10:19Z","dateModified":"2023-05-03T10:58:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KN28TKVW","itemID":376,"attachments":[{"key":"5F5CK7B5","version":6038,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2012-The Power of Kawaii.pdf","parentItem":"KN28TKVW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2012-The Power of Kawaii.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-16T10:24:48Z","dateModified":"2023-03-16T10:24:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5F5CK7B5","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\5F5CK7B5\\2012-The Power of Kawaii.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1120/2012-The Power of Kawaii.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494315,"version":0},"$loki":1386},{"itemID":1550,"item":{"key":"KNRFDZL6","version":5580,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mobile marketing research: The-state-of-the-art","abstractNote":"Rapid proliferation in the business potential of mobile marketing attracts researchers from various ﬁelds to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the phenomena.

En accord avec le calcul, le transfert de chaleur est mesuré dans le domaine de la convection mixte. De plus, à partir des mesures au fil chaud, on trouve une complète laminarisation dans la région de convection mixte à un nombre de Reynolds de 3000.\nZusammenfassung\nZur Berechnung der voll ausgebildeten Aufwärtsströmung in einem gleichmäβig beheizten senkrechten Rohr unter Berücksichtigung der Auftriebskraft wurde das k-ε-Turbulenzmodell für Strömungen bei kleinen Reynolds-Zahlen angewandt. Anhand der numerischen Berechnungen wurden sowohl für laminare als auch turbulente Strömungen Bereichskarten für erzwungene, gemischte und natürliche Konvektion erstellt. Zur gleichen Zeit wurden Versuche mit verdichtetem Stickstoff als Versuchsfluid bei Reynolds-Zahlen zwischen 3000 und 5000 in einem weiten Bereich von Grashof-Zahlen durchgeführt. In Übereinstimmung mit den Berechnungen wurde im Bereich der Mischkonvektion eine Beeinträchtigung des Wärmeübergangs durch die Auftriebsbewegung gemessen. Darüber hinaus wurde aufgrund von Hitzdrahtmessungen der vollständige Umschlag zur Laminarströmung im Bereich der Mischkonvektion bei einer Reynolds-Zahl von 3000 gezeigt.\nРеферат\nДля PayчeTa пoлнoyTью PaзвиToгo вoyчoдящeгo пoToкa B PaвнoмePнo нaгPeвaeмoй вePTикaльнoй TPcбe y cчeToм пoдъeмныч yил пPeдлoжeны k-ε мoдeли TcPбcлeнTнoyTи для Teчeния y мaлым чиyлoм Peйнoльдya.

It aims to support decision makers in making their decisions more effective and consistent. MCDM provides a useful and successful alternative for handling three main types of MCDM problems, namely, choosing, ranking and sorting. The first two are the most common problems studied but the third offers a way to deal with real world MCDM problems that require alternatives to be assigned to ordered categories. The practitioners are currently developing and applying sorting methods to solve problems from different application areas. In spite of its interest and applicability, there is only one previous review on Multiple-Criteria sorting, performed almost 20 years ago. Hence, because of its interest this paper presents a new and systematic review of MCDM sorting methods that includes 30 years of research in the field. This review has systematically analyzed the conventional and non-classical methods of MCDM sorting and then classified the papers published into 16 application areas. The analysis reveals that the methodological development is still in growth phase for MCDM sorting and discovers the applied methods’ trends. It also shows the complete spectrum of the areas of the application addressed, the state of knowledge about methods, the type of contribution to the knowledge, and the application area for the four categories of the MCDM approaches. The systematic review scrutinizes each selected article in order to find out which approach from the multi-criteria sorting presents the most development based on its contribution and application of the methods. We also aim to discover which Multiple-Criteria sorting methods are the most studied in MCDM. The relevant finding is the relation between the most applied methods and the application areas together with future directions for further research.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421007958","extra":"Citation Key: alvarez2021multiplecriteria","volume":"183","pages":"115368","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115368","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Pavel Anselmo","lastName":"Alvarez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Ishizaka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Martínez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Multi-criteria decision-making"},{"tag":"Decision rules"},{"tag":"Outranking"},{"tag":"Reference level"},{"tag":"Sorting"},{"tag":"Utility functions"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/L477ZB2L","itemID":1450,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494336,"version":0},"$loki":1390},{"itemID":1458,"item":{"key":"L4PGSR3G","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for data with unequal cluster sizes and contaminated with noise and outliers: Review and development","abstractNote":"Clustering algorithms aim at finding dense regions of data based on similarities and dissimilarities of data points. Noise and outliers contribute to the computational procedure of the algorithms as well as the actual data points that leads to inaccurate and misplaced cluster centers. This problem also arises when sizes of the clusters are different that moves centers of small clusters towards large clusters. Mass of the data points is important as well as their location in engineering and physics where non-uniform mass distribution results displacement of the cluster centers towards heavier clusters even if sizes of the clusters are identical and the data are noise-free. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm that suffers from these problems is the most popular fuzzy clustering algorithm and has been subject of numerous researches and developments though improvements are still marginal. This work revises the FCM algorithm to make it applicable to data with unequal cluster sizes, noise and outliers, and non-uniform mass distribution. Revised FCM (RFCM) algorithm employs adaptive exponential functions to eliminate impacts of noise and outliers on the cluster centers and modifies constraint of the FCM algorithm to prevent large or heavier clusters from attracting centers of small clusters. Several algorithms are reviewed and their mathematical structures are discussed in the paper including Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM), Possibilistic C-Means (PCM), Robust Fuzzy C-Means (FCM-σ), Noise Clustering (NC), Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM), Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM), Robust Kernel Fuzzy C-Mean (KFCM-σ), Robust Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM-σ), Kernel Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (KIFCM), Robust Kernel Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (KIFCM-σ), Credibilistic Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM), Size-insensitive integrity-based Fuzzy C-Means (siibFCM), Size-insensitive Fuzzy C-Means (csiFCM), Subtractive Clustering (SC), Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Spectral clustering, and Outlier Removal Clustering (ORC). Some of these algorithms are suitable for noisy data and some others are designed for data with unequal clusters. The study shows that the RFCM algorithm works for both cases and outperforms the both categories of the algorithms.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306679","extra":"Citation Key: askari2021fuzzy","volume":"165","pages":"113856","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113856","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Salar","lastName":"Askari","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Clustering"},{"tag":"FCM"},{"tag":"Fuzzy C-Means"},{"tag":"Noise"},{"tag":"Outlier"},{"tag":"Unequal clusters"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/L4PGSR3G","itemID":1458,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494340,"version":0},"$loki":1391},{"itemID":827,"item":{"key":"LA2EQ9IP","version":5502,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy Requirement","abstractNote":"The Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) is an information fusion framework and widely used in many ﬁelds. However, the uncertainty measure of a basic probability assignment (BPA) is still an open issue in DST. There are many methods to quantify the uncertainty of BPAs. However, the existing methods have some limitations. In this paper, a new total uncertainty measure from a perspective of maximum entropy requirement is proposed. The proposed method can measure both dissonance and non-speciﬁcity in BPA, which includes two components. The ﬁrst component is consistent with Yager’s dissonance measure. The second component is the non-speciﬁcity measurement with different functions. We also prove the desirable properties of the proposed method. Besides, numerical examples and applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed total uncertainty measure.","date":"2021-08-17","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"物理与天体物理3区","libraryCatalog":"物理：综合3区","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/8/1061","accessDate":"2022-12-27T14:42:43Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2021new","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"23","pages":"1061","publicationTitle":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23081061","issue":"8","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Entropy","ISSN":"1099-4300","creators":[{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fanghui","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-27T14:42:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LA2EQ9IP","itemID":827,"attachments":[{"key":"W4XIFKEX","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhang2021a.md","parentItem":"LA2EQ9IP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhang2021a.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:40:19Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:40:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/W4XIFKEX","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\W4XIFKEX\\@Zhang2021a.md","defaultPath":"files/1083/@Zhang2021a.md"},{"key":"4LT3VJ24","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy.pdf","parentItem":"LA2EQ9IP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy2.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/1\">Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/2\">Preliminaries</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/2\">Dempster-Shafer Theory</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/3\">Belief and Plausibility Function</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/3\">Shannon Entropy</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/3\">Some Existing Entropies in DST</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/5\">Proposed Uncertainty Measure in DST</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/5\">The Proposed Method</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/5\">Properties of the Proposed Method</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/7\">Numerical Examples</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/8\">Example 1</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/9\">Example 2</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/10\">Example 3</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/11\">Example 4</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/12\">Example 5</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/13\">Example 6</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/15\">Application</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/18\">Conclusions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_RXDF8UHJ/18\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-27T14:45:38Z","dateModified":"2022-12-27T14:45:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/4LT3VJ24","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\4LT3VJ24\\2021-A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1084/2021-A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy2.pdf"},{"key":"F58G8SG7","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhang2021a -

For instance, Nguyen proposed a belief entropy based on the original basic probability assignment (BPA) [34]. Dubois and Prade proposed a weighted Hartley entropy for measuring the non-specificity of BPAs [35]. In addition, many other belief entropies have been proposed, including Höhle’s entropy [36], Yager’s dissonance measure [37], Klir and Ramer’s discord measure [38], Klir and Parviz’s strife measure [39], Jousselme’s ambiguity measure (AM) [40], Deng entropy [41], Yang and Han’s measure [42], the aggregated uncertainty measure (AU) [43], Wang and Song’s measure (SU) [44], Jirousek and Shenoy’s entropy (JS) [45], Deng’s measure [46], and so on [47–49].”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10099416%2Fitems%2FLA2EQ9IP%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Zhang 等, 2021, p. 2</span>)</span> 基于上述分析，许多学者提出了不同的类熵测度来量化DST中证据体的不确定性。例如，Nguyen提出了一种基于原始基本概率分配( BPA )的信念熵[ 34 ]。Dubois和Prade提出了加权Hartley熵来衡量BPAs的非特异性[ 35 ]。此外，人们还提出了许多其他的信度熵，包括H ö hle熵[ 36 ]、Yager不一致测度[ 37 ]、Klir和Ramer不一致测度[ 38 ]、Klir和Parviz冲突测度[ 39 ]、Jousselme模糊测度( AM ) [ 40 ]、Deng熵[ 41 ]、Yang和Han测度[ 42 ]、聚合不确定测度( AU ) [ 43 ]、Wang和Song测度( SU ) [ 44 ]、伊劳谢克和Shenoy熵( JS ) [ 45 ]、Deng测度[ 46 ]等[ 47-49 ]。</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10099416%2Fitems%2FRXDF8UHJ%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22PBG2V4XK%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B188.524%2C517.426%2C560.931%2C527.368%5D%2C%5B167.265%2C504.873%2C559.279%2C514.815%5D%2C%5B167.265%2C492.32%2C561.016%2C502.262%5D%2C%5B166.956%2C479.767%2C559.277%2C489.709%5D%2C%5B167.265%2C467.214%2C559.279%2C477.156%5D%2C%5B166.966%2C454.661%2C559.661%2C464.603%5D%2C%5B167.265%2C442.108%2C264.679%2C452.05%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10099416%2Fitems%2FLA2EQ9IP%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">“Motivated by the above discussions, a new total uncertainty measure from a perspective of maximum entropy requirement is proposed.

How many of them are relevant to us? How many attract our attention? This ethical dilemma is problematic for individuals that involve complex and often conflicting principles of ethical behavior. Thus, this study examines the role of ethical and permission-based mobile marketing to measure this phenomenon of unethical sharing of promotional SMS to the customer. The five independent variables; ethics, trust, perceived control, actual control, perceived utility, and one dependent variable as acceptance of the mobile advertisement is deployed. We used 7 points Likert scale questionnaire and distributed it among 150 mobile phone users to empirically test the hypothesis through STATA 14.2. The empirical results of the study present that ethics and trust have a significant relationship with the acceptance of mobile marketing. Interestingly, the actual control of SMS received presents a less significant impact as compared to the perceived control on the acceptance of mobile marketing. The findings of the study hold very useful information for marketers to develop an effective, efficient and selective marketing strategy rather than push marketing tactics to attract more customers by providing them appropriate, informative, attractive, and trustworthy information.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","extra":"Citation Key:

distance of quantum mass function and its application in multi-source information fusion method based on discount coefficient","abstractNote":"Distance measures provide a novel perspective for measuring the difference or consistency between bodies of evidence, which have been used in a wide range of fields. However, under the framework of quantum mass function, existing distances cannot measure the difference. Hence, this paper formulates a new distance measure, referred to as the distance of the quantum mass functions. The purpose of this distance measure is to quantify the difference between quantum mass functions. It can be demonstrated mathematically that it is a strict distance measure that satisfies the nonnegativity, symmetry, definiteness, triangle inequality. The proposed distance measure is a generalization of the classical evidence distance, and it introduces the concept of Minkowski distance as well. It is therefore not only able to reflects the difference of discord and non-specificity in the mass functions, but it also has the advantage of Minkowski distance, as well as high compatibility. Moreover, A number of numerical examples are also provided to illustrate its properties and advantages. Using the proposed distance measure, we design a new information fusion method based on the discount coefficient within a complex framework. As a further investigation, the proposed fusion method is applied to several data sets experiments and results indicate that compared to other methods, it has a certain potential in the field of multi-source information fusion under the framework of evidence theory.","date":"11/2022","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197622004018","accessDate":"2022-11-16T02:47:04Z","extra":"Citation Key: pan2022distance","volume":"116","pages":"105407","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105407","journalAbbreviation":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"09521976","creators":[{"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Pan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaozhuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T02:47:04Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LI7W9KPQ","itemID":441,"attachments":[{"key":"2DDQSL8Q","version":6038,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2022-A distance of quantum mass function and its application in multi-source.pdf","parentItem":"LI7W9KPQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2022-A distance of quantum mass function and its application in multi-source.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

It is concerned with the identiﬁcation of the levels of preference that decision makers have towards certain decision alternatives (DAs), through preference judgements made over a number of different criteria. The working result from a DS/AHP analysis is the body of evidence (BOE), which includes a series of mass values that represent the exact beliefs in the best DA(s) existing within certain subsets of DAs. This paper considers the role of DS/AHP as an aid to group decision-making, through the utilisation of a distance measure (between BOEs). Here, the distance measure enables the identiﬁcation of the members of the decision-making group who are in most agreement, with respect to the judgements they have individually made. The utilisation of a single linkage dendrite approach to clustering elucidates an appropriate order to the aggregation of the judgements of the group members. This develops the DS/AHP method as a tool to identify inter-group alliances, as well as introduce a ‘majority rule’ approach to decision-making through consensus building.","date":"1/2006","language":"en","archive":"Q2/Q3","callNumber":"2.9279","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10726-005-1159-9","accessDate":"2023-03-15T07:12:35Z","rights":"2.5271","extra":"Citation Key: beynon2006role","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"15","pages":"21-42","publicationTitle":"Group Decision and Negotiation","DOI":"10.1007/s10726-005-1159-9","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Group Decis Negot","ISSN":"0926-2644, 1572-9907","creators":[{"firstName":"Malcolm J.","lastName":"Beynon","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:12:35Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LKPE23CI","itemID":960,"attachments":[{"key":"KC6H8A4L","version":6046,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-The Role of the DS-AHP in Identifying Inter-Group Alliances and Majority Rule.pdf","parentItem":"LKPE23CI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2006-The Role of the DS-AHP in Identifying Inter-Group Alliances and Majority Rule.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-16T10:25:02Z","dateModified":"2023-03-16T10:25:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KC6H8A4L","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\KC6H8A4L\\2006-The Role of the DS-AHP in Identifying Inter-Group Alliances and Majority Rule.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1195/2006-The Role of the DS-AHP in Identifying Inter-Group Alliances and Majority Rule.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494408,"version":0},"$loki":1399},{"itemID":636,"item":{"key":"LVDVMCS7","version":5499,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heat transfer characteristics of a two-phase closed thermosyphon","date":"3/2005","language":"en","archive":"Q1/Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术2区 Top","libraryCatalog":"热力学2区  能源与燃料2区  工程：机械2区  力学2区","callNumber":"6.4650","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359431104001838","accessDate":"2022-12-07T02:38:48Z","rights":"5.906","extra":"Citation Key: noie2005heat","volume":"25","pages":"495-506","publicationTitle":"Applied Thermal Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2004.06.019","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Therm Eng","ISSN":"13594311","creators":[{"firstName":"S.H.","lastName":"Noie","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T02:38:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LVDVMCS7","itemID":636,"attachments":[{"key":"KV3QY8SN","version":6038,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2005-Heat transfer characteristics of a two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf","parentItem":"LVDVMCS7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2005-Heat transfer characteristics of a two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Well-located and well-designed warehouses can make reaching these aims for the automotive industry possible and more accessible. Hence, determining a location for a warehouse is a highly critical, tactical, and managerial resolution for the automotive industry, as there is a strong correlation between well-located warehouses and the well-structured logistics network in the automotive industry. Although the WSS is a significant decision-making problem, we observed four critical and severe gaps in the existing literature: (1) the authors preferred to apply traditional objective & subjective frames, and they overlooked existing highly complicated uncertainties. (2) The number of studies focusing on the WSS problem in the automotive industry is surprisingly scarce. (3) It is not sufficiently clear how these factors used in the previous studies were determined, which causes doubts about their reliability. (4) there is no satisfactory evidence of which approaches were used to identify the factors in the previous papers. By considering these gaps, we propose two approaches which can be accepted as a novelty of the paper. First is the extension of the Delphi techniques based on the Fermetean fuzzy sets (FFs) used for identifying the criteria. It also combines the two traditional approaches (i.e., literature review and professionals' evaluations to identify the criteria) with the FF-Delphi technique. The second is the Double Normalized MARCOS approach based on FFs (FF- DN MARCOS) implemented to identify the weights of the criteria and ranking performance of the alternatives. The proposed model was implemented to identify the best warehouse location for the automotive manufacturing company. The results show that the C1 “energy availability & cost” criterion is the most influential criterion and the C5 proximity to port and customs criterion is the second most crucial factor. Then we executed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, and the results approved the suggested model's validity and robustness despite excessive modifications in the criteria weights.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422015809","extra":"Citation Key: saha2023warehouse","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"211","pages":"118497","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118497","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Saha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamucar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Omer F.","lastName":"Gorcun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arunodaya","lastName":"Raj Mishra","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"double normalized MARCOS"},{"tag":"The automotive industry"},{"tag":"the Fermatean fuzzy sets"},{"tag":"Warehouse site selection"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/MC2J7MH3","itemID":1411,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494431,"version":0},"$loki":1405},{"itemID":443,"item":{"key":"MH6W3HU3","version":5497,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Classifier Fusion With Contextual Reliability Evaluation","abstractNote":"Classiﬁer fusion is an efﬁcient strategy to improve the classiﬁcation performance for the complex pattern recognition problem. In practice, the multiple classiﬁers to combine can have different reliabilities and the proper reliability evaluation plays an important role in the fusion process for getting the best classiﬁcation performance. We propose a new method for classiﬁer fusion with contextual reliability evaluation (CFCRE) based on inner reliability and relative reliability concepts. The inner reliability, represented by a matrix, characterizes the probability of the object belonging to one class when it is classiﬁed to another class. The elements of this matrix are estimated from the K-nearest neighbors of the object. A cautious discounting rule is developed under belief functions framework to revise the classiﬁcation result according to the inner reliability. The relative reliability is evaluated based on a new incompatibility measure which allows to reduce the level of conﬂict between the classiﬁers by applying the classical evidence discounting rule to each classiﬁer before their combination. The inner reliability and relative reliability capture different aspects of the classiﬁcation reliability. The discounted classiﬁcation results are combined with Dempster–Shafer’s rule for the ﬁnal class decision making support. The performance of CF-CRE have been evaluated and compared with those of main classical fusion methods using real data sets. The experimental results show that CF-CRE can produce substantially higher accuracy than other fusion methods in general. Moreover, CF-CRE is robust to the changes of the number of nearest neighbors chosen for estimating the reliability matrix, which is appealing for the applications.","date":"5/2018","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7944663/","accessDate":"2022-11-16T02:47:15Z","extra":"Citation Key: liu2018classifier","volume":"48","pages":"1605-1618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","DOI":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2710205","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of such probability transformations (PTs), which are crucial for their proper applications and the design of new ones. Shannon entropy or probabilistic information content (PIC) measure is traditionally used in evaluating PTs. The transformation having the lowest entropy or highest PIC is considered as the best one. This standpoint is questioned in this paper by comparing a PT based on uncertainty minimization with other available PTs. It shows experimentally that entropy or PIC is not comprehensive to evaluate a PT. To make a comprehensive evaluation, some new approaches are proposed by the joint use of PIC and the distance of evidence according to the value- and rank-based fusion. A pattern classiﬁcation application oriented evaluation approach for PTs is also proposed. Some desired properties for PTs are also discussed. Experimental results and related analysis are provided to show the rationality of the new evaluation approaches.","date":"1/2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7097080/","accessDate":"2023-03-05T13:06:14Z","extra":"Citation Key: han2016evaluation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"46","pages":"93-108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2421883","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

How to construct the the connection between Pascal triangle and uncertainty measure is an interesting topic. One of the most used entropy, Tasllis entropy, has been modelled with Pascal triangle. But the relationship of the other entropy functions with Pascal triangle is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory takes the advantage to deal with uncertainty than probability theory since the probability distribution is generalized as basic probability assignment, which is more eﬃcient to model and handle uncertain information. Given a basic probability assignment, its corresponding uncertainty measure can be determined by Deng entropy, which is the generalization of Shannon entropy. In this paper, a Pseudo-Pascal triangle based the maximum Deng entropy is constructed. Similar to the Pascal triangle modelling of Tasllis entropy, this work provides the a possible way of Deng entropy in physics and information theory.","date":"2020-02-03","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/1006","accessDate":"2022-09-18T14:15:03Z","extra":"Citation Key: gao2020pseudopascal","volume":"15","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2020.1.3735","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

If uncertainties in the modelling process are not or are incorrectly accounted for, fusion processes may provide under- or overconfident results, or in some cases incorrect results. These are often owing to incorrect or invalid simplifying assumptions during the modelling process. The authors investigate the sources of uncertainty in the modelling process. In particular, four processes of abstraction are identified where uncertainty may enter the modelling process. These are isolation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced by isolating a portion of the real world to be modelled), datum uncertainty (where uncertainty is introduced by representing real world information by a mathematical quantity), data generation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of the mapping between a real-world process and an observable datum), and process abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of real world entities and processes). The uncertainties associated with these abstraction processes are characterised according to the uncertainty representation and reasoning evaluation framework (URREF) ontology.

Owing to its advantages, evidence theory has more ﬂexibility and eﬀectiveness for modeling and processing uncertain information. Uncertainty measure plays an essential role both in evidence theory and probability theory. In probability theory, Shannon entropy provides a novel perspective for measuring uncertainty. Various entropies exist for measuring the uncertainty of basic probability assignment (BPA) in evidence theory. However, from the standpoint of the requirements of uncertainty measurement and physics, these entropies are controversial. Therefore, the process for measuring BPA uncertainty currently remains an open issue in the literature. Firstly, this paper reviews the measures of uncertainty in evidence theory followed by an analysis of some related controversies. Secondly, we discuss the development of Deng entropy as an eﬀective way to measure uncertainty, including introducing its deﬁnition, analyzing its properties, and comparing it to other measures. We also examine the concept of maximum Deng entropy, the pseudo-Pascal triangle of maximum Deng entropy, generalized belief entropy, and measures of divergence. In addition, we conduct an analysis of the application of Deng entropy and further examine the challenges for future studies on uncertainty measurement in evidence theory.

But it is not explored much as yet in the context of Internet of Things. Internet of Things work with a massive amount of data so the responsibility for guaranteeing the accuracy of the data also lies with it. Moreover, a lot of important and critical decisions are made based on these data, so ensuring its correctness and accuracy is also very important. Also, the detection needs to be as precise as possible to avoid negative alerts. For this purpose, this work has adopted Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence to collate the information from sensors to come up with a decision regarding the faulty status of a sensor node from a data-centric perspective. To verify the validity of the proposed method, simulations have been performed on a benchmark data set and data collected through a test bed in a laboratory set-up. For the different types of faults, the proposed method shows very high accuracy for both the benchmark (99.8%) and laboratory data sets (99.9%) when compared to the other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306898","extra":"Citation Key: ghosh2020fault","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"162","pages":"113887","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113887","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Nimisha","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rourab","lastName":"Paul","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Maity","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krishanu","lastName":"Maity","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sayantan","lastName":"Saha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Classification"},{"tag":"Data fusion"},{"tag":"Dempster–Shafer"},{"tag":"Fault detection"},{"tag":"Internet of Things (IoT)"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/N4IKJ4CW","itemID":1416,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494473,"version":0},"$loki":1413},{"itemID":1553,"item":{"key":"N55DCHM2","version":5582,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Privacy Issues in Mobile Advertising","abstractNote":"The emergence of the wired Internet and mobile telecommunication networks is creating new opportunities for advertisers to generate new revenue streams through mobile users.

Despite the explosion of data availability in recent decades, as yet there is no well-developed theoretical basis for multimodal data fusion, i.e., no way to determine a priori which approach is best suited to combine an arbitrary set of available data to achieve a stated goal for a given application. This has resulted in exploration of a wide variety of approaches across numerous domains but as yet very little integration of conclusions at a meta (cross-disciplinary) level. In response, this manuscript poses the following questions: (1) How convergent (or divergent) are approaches within single disciplines? (2) How similar are the challenges posed across different disciplines, i.e., might there be opportunity for successes in MMDF achieved in one field to inform progress in other areas as well? and (3) Where are the outstanding gaps in MMDF research, and what does this imply as targets for high impact research in the coming years? To begin to answer these questions, an apples-to-apples comparison of the literature of nine stakeholder-centric engineering domains (civil engineering, transportation, energy, environmental engineering, food engineering, critical care (healthcare), neuroscience, manufacturing/automation, and robotics) was created by quantifying the numbers and dimensionalities of modalities and sensors in each published project and classifying the algorithms used and purposes for which they are used. Within disciplines, it is shown there is often a tendency for use of similar methodologies, both in choice of level of fusion and data algorithm class. Yet this analysis also reveals that many problem types (defined by data dimensionality, modality number and type, and fusion purpose) are shared across different domains and are approached differently in those domains, e.g., transportation problems have similar characteristics to critical care, food science, robotics, and civil engineering. Of the disciplines studied, most (¿75%) share problem characteristics with 3–5 others; to support leveraging these resources, lookup tables indexed by data dimensions, number of modalities, etc. are provided as a starting point for cross-disciplinary MMDF literature searches for new applications. Critical gaps identified are (1) a drop off of the number of published studies with increasing number of distinct modalities and (2) a dearth of publications tackling challenges with high dimensionality inputs, especially time-series 2D and 3D data. These gaps may point to topics where algorithm development will be fruitful to enable future solutions as video and other high-dimensionality sensors decrease in price. Finally, the lack of a shared vocabulary across disciplines makes analyses like the one conducted here challenging, as does the often implicit incorporation of expert knowledge into design; therefore progress toward a better leveraging of the current state of knowledge and toward a theoretical MMDF framework depends critically on improved cross-disciplinary communication and coordination on this topic.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420306886","extra":"Citation Key: bokade2021crossdisciplinary","volume":"165","pages":"113885","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113885","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Bokade","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Navato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ruilin","lastName":"Ouyang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaoning","lastName":"Jin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chun-An","lastName":"Chou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Ostadabbas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amy V.","lastName":"Mueller","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Big data"},{"tag":"Complex systems"},{"tag":"Multimodal data fusion"},{"tag":"Trans-disciplinary"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NAML5Z3P","itemID":1478,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494485,"version":0},"$loki":1416},{"itemID":1418,"item":{"key":"NDJD9L7J","version":5511,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Cautious weighted random forests","abstractNote":"Random forest is an efficient and accurate classification model, which makes decisions by aggregating a set of trees, either by voting or by averaging class posterior probability estimates. However, tree outputs may be unreliable in presence of scarce data. The imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM) provides workaround, by replacing point probability estimates with interval-valued ones. This paper investigates a new tree aggregation method based on the theory of belief functions to combine such probability intervals, resulting in a cautious random forest classifier. In particular, we propose a strategy for computing tree weights based on the minimization of a convex cost function, which takes both determinacy and accuracy into account and makes it possible to adjust the level of cautiousness of the model. The proposed model is evaluated on 25 UCI datasets and is demonstrated to be more adaptive to the noise in training data and to achieve a better compromise between informativeness and cautiousness.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422019017","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2023cautious","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"213","pages":"118883","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118883","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Haifei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Quost","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-Hélène","lastName":"Masson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief functions"},{"tag":"Cautious classification"},{"tag":"Imprecise classification"},{"tag":"Imprecise dirichlet model"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NDJD9L7J","itemID":1418,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494488,"version":0},"$loki":1417},{"itemID":938,"item":{"key":"NGTG5BAV","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1-1.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1-1.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T07:11:04Z","dateModified":"2023-03-15T07:11:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NGTG5BAV","itemID":938,"localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\NGTG5BAV\\1-1.pdf","defaultPath":"files/938/1-1.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494491,"version":0},"$loki":1418},{"itemID":168,"item":{"key":"NJBEGSRN","version":5493,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Effect of a Cute Stimulus on Personally-Initiated, Self-Administered Surveys","abstractNote":"Two experiments are described that used a cute stimulus to enhance the response to a personally-initiated, self-administered survey.

IFS is comprised of distributed and heterogeneous systems that accomplish low-level and high-level information fusion (LLIF and HLIF) functionality. LLIF and HLIF functions are developed independent from one another but require collaboration to achieve the IFS mission objectives. The distribution and heterogeneity of systems, in addition to the multiplicity of LLIF and HLIF functions, creates an extensively large design space for the IFS. We apply a SoS engineering architecting process to obtain integrated architectures of IFS and propose guidelines to constrain an otherwise infinite design space of Information Fusion System-of-Systems (IF-SoS). Furthermore, we elaborate a multi-agent system modeling approach and pair it with Design of Experiments for objective evaluation of the IF-SoS design space. The statistical analysis, based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Range Tests, quantifies the impact of interactions between LLIF and HLIF design considerations on the IF-SoS performance. Furthermore, statistical evidence is provided to demonstrate that the interactions among JDL levels, in particular between LLIF and HLIF, are the most significant design considerations for fusion performance which necessitate an integrated design and evaluation of LLIF and HLIF—a manifestation of the SoS perspective for the IFS.","date":"2017-05-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253516300859","accessDate":"2022-11-05T00:56:08Z","extra":"Citation Key: raz2017systemofsystems","volume":"35","pages":"148-165","publicationTitle":"Information Fusion","DOI":"10.1016/j.inffus.2016.10.002","journalAbbreviation":"Information Fusion","ISSN":"1566-2535","creators":[{"firstName":"Ali K.","lastName":"Raz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.

of heating surface morphology on the size of bubbles during the subcooled flow boiling of water at low pressure","abstractNote":"An experimental investigation on the forced convective subcooled ﬂow boiling of water was carried out using image processing. Three copper test parts of different roughness were tested at different operational conditions established through a design of experiments, covering bulk velocities from 0.1 m/s to 0.9 m/s, bulk temperature from 76.5 °C to 93.5 °C, and operating pressures from 110 kPa to 190 kPa. The boiling process has been maintained on the nucleate regimen varying heat ﬂux from 0.1 MW/m2 to 1 MW/m2, though image processing was only feasible below 0.65 MW/m2. The result of the experimental work is a database of the size distribution of the bubbles at each experimental point and presented as an electronic annex. The results conﬁrmed that bubbles are generally smaller at higher pressure, higher velocities and higher levels of subcooling. The effect of surface morphology proved to be a very strong factor that is normally ignored by correlations and experimental works. Finally, an analysis of the possibility of the interaction of surface morphology with bubble size is presented.","date":"10/2015","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org

Responses to <i>Kawaii</i> Pictures With or Without Baby Schema","abstractNote":"Baby schema has been considered a key stimulus that triggers feelings and thoughts of cuteness. Kawaii is a Japanese word that roughly translates to cute in English, but its meaning appears to be broader than cute. Specifically, cuteness is often regarded as synonymous with infant physical attractiveness, whereas kawaii is used not only for babies but also for noninfantile objects. In this study, psychophysiological responses were compared between two types of kawaii pictures: human babies and animals (kawaii with baby schema) or objects such as desserts and dress accessories (kawaii without baby schema). Twenty female university students were asked to view various pictures twice. Both types of kawaii pictures were rated to be more pleasant than neutral pictures, elicited a greater activation of the zygomaticus major muscles associated with smiling, and were viewed for a longer period when the same pictures were presented again. The effect of baby schema appeared in the zygomaticus major muscle activity, which was greater for pictures with baby schema. The findings suggest that the word kawaii expresses positive feelings that are more generic than infant attractiveness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a preferable object.","date":"04/2017","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244017709321","accessDate":"2022-10-30T15:39:59Z","extra":"Citation Key: nittono2017psychophysiological","volume":"7","pages":"215824401770932","publicationTitle":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244017709321","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"SAGE Open","ISSN":"2158-2440, 2158-2440","creators":[{"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nittono","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Namiha","lastName":"Ihara","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["GSXRUD79"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YQC5QIA4"]},"dateAdded":"2022-10-30T15:39:59Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Q4V2XPD9","itemID":177,"attachments":[{"key":"HEYM3I2V","version":6038,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2017-Psychophysiological Responses to iKawaii-i Pictures With or Without Baby.pdf","parentItem":"Q4V2XPD9","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017-Psychophysiological Responses to iKawaii-i Pictures With or Without Baby.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/C7HYB8XR"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-03T06:03:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:25:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/HEYM3I2V","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\HEYM3I2V\\2017-Psychophysiological Responses to iKawaii-i Pictures With or Without Baby.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1119/2017-Psychophysiological Responses to iKawaii-i Pictures With or Without Baby.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494601,"version":0},"$loki":1434},{"itemID":1412,"item":{"key":"Q6H4EBGQ","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Harnessing heterogeneous social networks for better recommendations: A grey relational analysis approach","abstractNote":"Most of the extant studies in social recommender system are based on explicit social relationships, while the potential of implicit relationships in the heterogeneous social networks remains largely unexplored. This study proposes a new approach to designing a recommender system by employing grey relational analysis on the heterogeneous social networks. It starts with the establishment of heterogeneous social networks through the user-item bipartite graph, user social network graph and user-attribute bipartite graph; and then uses grey relational analysis to identify implicit social relationships, which are then incorporated into the matrix factorization model. Five experiments were conducted to test the performance of our approach against four state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results show that compared with the baseline methods, our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem, because the heterogeneous social network provides richer information. In addition, the grey relational analysis method has the advantage of low requirements for data size and efficiently relieves the cold start problem. Furthermore, our approach saves processing time, thus increases recommendation efficiency. Overall, the proposed approach can effectively improve the accuracy of rating prediction in social recommendations and provide accurate and efficient recommendation service for users.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421002128","extra":"Citation Key: weng2021harnessing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"174","pages":"114771","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114771","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Weng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qishan","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Grey relational analysis"},{"tag":"Heterogeneous social network"},{"tag":"Implicit social relationships"},{"tag":"Recommendation algorithm"},{"tag":"Recommender system"},{"tag":"User profile"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:53:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Q6H4EBGQ","itemID":1412,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494605,"version":0},"$loki":1435},{"itemID":492,"item":{"key":"Q6LR2UM4","version":5498,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heat and mass transfer mechanisms of a self-sustained thermally driven oscillating liquid–vapour meniscus","abstractNote":"Self-sustained thermally-induced oscillations of a meniscus in a two-phase system, consisting of a liquid plug and a vapour bubble in a capillary tube, are studied. This system represents the simplest ‘unit-cell’ version of a pulsating heat pipe (PHP). An experimental setup has been built to visualise and record the meniscus oscillations and the thin liquid ﬁlm that is laid on the wall when the meniscus leaves the evaporator. The pressure and temperature of the vapour are also simultaneously measured. When the temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink increases, different meniscus dynamics, having excellent repeatability, is observed. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that evaporation of the liquid ﬁlm is responsible for these patterns. The different components of evaporation and condensation processes are critically analysed. Two different modes of evaporation are observed inside the system: one at the triple-line and one at the liquid–vapour interface.

Attenuation under water varies with wavelength, unlike terrestrial images where attenuation is assumed to be spectrally uniform. The attenuation depends both on the water body and the 3D structure of the scene, making color restoration difficult. Unlike existing single underwater image enhancement techniques, our method takes into account multiple spectral profiles of different water types. By estimating just two additional global parameters: the attenuation ratios of the blue-red and blue-green color channels, the problem is reduced to single image dehazing, where all color channels have the same attenuation coefficients. Since the water type is unknown, we evaluate different parameters out of an existing library of water types. Each type leads to a different restored image and the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution. We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying water properties, showing color charts in the scenes. Moreover, to obtain ground truth, the 3D structure of the scene was calculated based on stereo imaging. This dataset enables a quantitative evaluation of restoration algorithms on natural images and shows the advantage of our method.","date":"2019-03-24","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01343","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:32:42Z","extra":"arXiv:1811.01343 [cs]\nversion: 3\nCitation Key: berman2019underwater","repository":"arXiv","archiveID":"arXiv:1811.01343","citationKey":"berman2019Underwater","creators":[{"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Berman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Levy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shai","lastName":"Avidan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Treibitz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"开源"},{"tag":"色衰"},{"tag":"color restoration"},{"tag":"spectral profiles"},{"tag":"underwater images"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-29T05:32:42Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QKEY7V6D","itemID":1318,"attachments":[{"key":"92SRKJVK","version":6048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2019-Underwater Single Image Color Restoration Using Haze-Lines and a New.pdf","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01343v3.pdf","accessDate":"2023-03-29T05:33:00Z","parentItem":"QKEY7V6D","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2019-Underwater Single Image Color Restoration Using Haze-Lines and a New.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Existing trading systems in Forex markets based on technical analysis use crisp technical indicators to provide Buy/Sell signals to the trader, only when the indicator value crosses a given threshold level. This strict and noise-sensitive condition can be replaced through uncertainty handling of indicators using fuzzy numbers to generate Buy/Sell signals with fuzzy memberships functions. To achieve this purpose, this paper presents a combined technique based on ensemble multi-class support vector machine (EmcSVM) and fuzzy NSGA-II for efficient trend classification and trading in Forex markets. At first, EmcSVM is used to forecast and classify the future market trend into uptrend, sideway, and downtrend. Then, NSGA-II is applied to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed fuzzy trading system comprising multiple AND-OR Buy/Sell technical rules for uptrend/downtrend markets. The hyperparameters include indicator selection within each rule, importance weights of the different rules, and final decision thresholds for Buy/Sell models, while the objective is to maximize average return on investment (ROI) and minimize average draw-down of all transactions. The proposed method has been successfully developed and tested on real data from the Forex market for EUR/USD currency pair in a 6-year timeframe from 2014 to 2019. Obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing crisp trading systems, with 80.8% precision, 72.4% recall, 94.1% annual ROI, and 0.58% draw down.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009726","extra":"Citation Key: sadeghi2021combined","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"185","pages":"115566","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115566","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sadeghi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Daneshvar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Madanchi Zaj","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ensemble learning"},{"tag":"Forex market"},{"tag":"Fuzzy logic"},{"tag":"NSGA-II"},{"tag":"Technical analysis"},{"tag":"Trend classification"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QKIV3JW2","itemID":1427,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117494631,"version":0},"$loki":1440},{"itemID":335,"item":{"key":"QLL8GMX3","version":5495,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Uncertainty evaluation of data and information fusion within the context of the decision loop","abstractNote":"In this paper, the principle taxonomy of the fusion process, the decision loop, is unified with uncertainty quantification and representation. A typical flow of information in the decision loop takes the form of raw information, uncertainty modelling, combination, and decisions, which corresponds closely with Boyd's Observe, Orient, Decide and Act or OODA loop. The uncertainty associated with modelling during fusion system design was considered in previous works by the authors of this paper. Here, the uncertainties in the combination and decision parts of the information flow are considered. The objective of this paper is to make explicit how uncertainties that arise during design, combine with uncertainties during runtime, as well as the effect these uncertainties have on the ultimate decisions. The uncertainty representation and reasoning framework (URREF) ontology can only be meaningfully used for evaluation when the subjects of evaluation within the fusion system, and more broadly the decision loop, are defined explicitly.","date":"2016-07","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","extra":"Citation Key: devilliers2016uncertainty","pages":"766-773","proceedingsTitle":"2016 19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","conferenceName":"2016 19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

Aspect ratio was 5 while the inclination angels were 0�, 80� and 90�, and the evaporator temperature were 50, 70 and 90 �C. Furthermore, the addition rate of chemical reactants was 50% by volume of the evaporator component whilst the water temper­ ature within the condensation unit was maintained at 20 �C. From the experimental results, the TPCT’s inner diameter was 7 mm, the inclination angels were at 80� and 90�. There were four types of flow pattern including; bubble flow pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and annular flow pattern. Churn flow pattern and the annular flow pattern affected the heat transfer rate of the TPCT with the inner diameter of 7 mm at the inclination angels of 80 and 90� respectively. As for the TPCT test, the inner diameter of 25.2 mm with the inclination angels of 80� resulted in four types of the flow patterns, including the bubble flow pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and stratified flow pattern respectively. According to the results, churn and stratified flow patterns, were the types of flow that affected the heat transfer rate. According to the experiment of TPCT with inner diameter of 25.2 mm at the inclination angels of 90�, four flow patterns including the bubble pattern, slug flow pattern, churn flow pattern and the vortex flow pattern were found. The vertex flow pattern was initiated when the temperature of the evaporator section was raised from 70 to 90 �C. According to this experiment, the churn flow and the vortex flow patterns were able to affect the heat transfer rates. Furthermore, the experiment revealed that heat flux that was obtained from the experiments of TPCT with the inner diameter of 7 and 25.2 mm showed the highest heat transfer rate at evaporation temperature of 90 �C and the inclination angels of 80� which were 31.88 and 58.15 W, respectively.","date":"04/2020","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"热力学3区","callNumber":"6.2682","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214157X19302862","accessDate":"2022-12-07T03:01:51Z","rights":"5.842","extra":"Citation Key: sichamnan2020case","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"18","pages":"100586","publicationTitle":"Case Studies in Thermal Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.csite.2020.100586","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Case Studies in Thermal Engineering","ISSN":"2214157X","creators":[{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Sichamnan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Chompookham","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Parametthanuwat","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T03:01:51Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QN7HP7G7","itemID":640,"attachments":[{"key":"LA4EBKI5","version":6037,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2020-A case study on internal flow patterns of the two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf","parentItem":"QN7HP7G7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2020-A case study on internal flow patterns of the two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/1\">1 Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/5\">2 The experimental apparatus and analysis</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/5\">2.1 Method</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/5\">2.2 The schematic diagram of the equipment, instrument setup and the two phase closed thermosyphon (TPCT)</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/5\">2.3 Heat transfer rate and flow patterns analysis</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/7\">2.4 Uncertainty analysis</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/8\">3 Results and discussion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/8\">3.1 Behavior of flow patterns within two - phase closed thermosyphon (TPCT)</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/9\">3.2 Effects of the evaporator temperatures and the inclination angles on flow patterns</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/11\">3.3 Effects of the evaporator temperature and inclination angle on the heat transfer</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/13\">3.4 Relationship of flow patterns-velocity and heat transfer rate</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/16\">4 Results</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/17\">Acknowledgments</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/17\">Appendix A Supplementary data</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VKVEG6HR/17\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-07T05:40:52Z","dateModified":"2022-12-07T05:40:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LA4EBKI5","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\LA4EBKI5\\2020-A case study on internal flow patterns of the two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1102/2020-A case study on internal flow patterns of the two-phase closed thermosyphon.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495004,"version":0},"$loki":1442},{"itemID":1464,"item":{"key":"QQTXPKXU","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"How much do the central bank announcements matter on financial market?

Our results show that the individual transactions delivered profits in 72.7% cases. The overall profitability across all events and all trading horizons was positive in as many as 63.6% cases. Although the financial market in Poland was only moderately sensitive to the NBP central bank’s communication, the identified types of the monetary policy announcements are economically significant and very useful for the investors, who can trade based on them and exploit them directly in the design of the rule-based trading strategies.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421006357","extra":"Citation Key: brzeszczynski2021how","volume":"182","pages":"115201","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115201","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Brzeszczyński","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Gajdka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Schabek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ali M.","lastName":"Kutan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bonds market"},{"tag":"Central bank"},{"tag":"Foreign exchange market"},{"tag":"Monetary policy"},{"tag":"Rule-based trading system"},{"tag":"Stock market"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QQTXPKXU","itemID":1464,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495008,"version":0},"$loki":1443},{"itemID":508,"item":{"key":"QR3FFUS4","version":5498,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A novel discrete model for granular material incorporating rolling resistance","abstractNote":"This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete model for granular materials with rolling resistance. The salient features of our formulation are: it consists of a geometrically derived kinematical model, physically based mechanical contact models and locally equilibrated equations governing the motion of the rigid particles; only one additional parameter d needs to be introduced in the model when compared with the standard discrete element method (DEM). In the study, precise deﬁnitions of pure sliding and pure rolling were proposed, and a decomposition of a general contact displacement was given in terms of these rolling and sliding components which are then linked to energy dissipation. The standard DEM assumption that grains are in contact at discrete points was here replaced by the assumption that grains are in contact over a width. By making the idealization that the grain contact width is continuously distributed with normal/tangential basic elements, we established a rolling contact model together with normal/tangential contact models, and also related the governing equations to local equilibrium. As an example of its application, the present model was incorporated into a DEM code to study the angle of internal friction / of the material. Fifty-four DEM simulations showed that / predicted by the novel model was increased in comparison to the standard DEM prediction, and may be closer to the values observed experimentally provided that the d–/ relationship established in this paper was used.","date":"7/2005","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0266352X05000649","accessDate":"2022-11-20T11:54:00Z","extra":"Citation Key: jiang2005novel","volume":"32","pages":"340-357","publicationTitle":"Computers and Geotechnics","DOI":"10.1016/j.compgeo.2005.05.001","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Computers and Geotechnics","ISSN":"0266352X","creators":[{"firstName":"M.J.","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H.-S.","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Harris","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RLN987UH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-20T11:54:00Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QR3FFUS4","itemID":508,"attachments":[{"key":"4RV7TZ94","version":6041,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2005-A novel discrete model for granular material incorporating rolling resistance.pdf","parentItem":"QR3FFUS4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2005-A novel discrete model for granular material incorporating rolling resistance.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Evidence reasoning approach is used to aggregate the evaluation information of quantitative criteria (i.e., weight and economics) and qualitative criteria (i.e., repair ability, reliability and convenience). Then, a mathematical repair equipment allocation model of a support-and-repair ship is formulated, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear model. A removal strategy based on a greedy algorithm that modifies infeasible solutions is designed to facilitate the use of a genetic algorithm with an elite strategy to address the model above. The proposed solution method using the removal strategy based on the greedy algorithm obtains better solution accuracy and global search performance than three widely used penalty-based methods by several test instances generated randomly. The results of a case study prove that the mathematical model and solution method can effectively obtain the optimal repair equipment allocation solution. The hybrid multi-criteria decision making and optimization approach has certain guiding significance for decision makers to determine their repair equipment allocation strategies for support-and-repair ships on a deep sea in practice.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420304826","extra":"Citation Key: zhao2020repair","volume":"160","pages":"113658","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113658","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Ruijia","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinlian","lastName":"Xie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenzhang","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Evidence theory"},{"tag":"Genetic algorithm"},{"tag":"Removal strategy"},{"tag":"Repair equipment allocation"},{"tag":"Support-and-repair ship"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QVAX58UV","itemID":1469,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495025,"version":0},"$loki":1447},{"itemID":339,"item":{"key":"QYI5EVIG","version":5495,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multi-source information fusion based on rough set theory: A review","abstractNote":"Multi-Source Information Fusion (MSIF) is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary subject, and is referred to as, multi-sensor information fusion which was originated in the 1970s. Nowadays, the types and updates of data are becoming more multifarious and frequent, which bring new challenges for information fusion to deal with the multi-source data. Consequently, the construction of MSIF models suitable for different scenarios and the application of different fusion technologies are the core problems that need to be solved urgently. Rough set theory (RST) provides a computing paradigm for uncertain data modeling and reasoning, especially for classification issues with noisy, inaccurate or incomplete data. Furthermore, due to the rapid development of MSIF in recent years, the methodologies of learning under RST are becoming increasingly mature and systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in the literature. In order to better clarify the approaches and application of MSIF in RST research community, this paper reviews the existing models and technologies from the perspectives of MSIF model (i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous MSIF model), multi-view rough sets information fusion model (i.e., multi-granulation, multi-scale and multi-view decisions information fusion models), parallel computing information fusion model, incremental learning fusion technology and cluster ensembles fusion technology. Finally, RST based MSIF related research directions and challenges are also covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art understanding in specialized literature, this survey will directly help researchers understand the research developments of MSIF under RST.","date":"2021-04-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Multi-source information fusion based on rough set theory","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253520304085","accessDate":"2022-11-05T00:59:47Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2021multisource","volume":"68","pages":"85-117","publicationTitle":"Information Fusion","DOI":"10.1016/j.inffus.2020.11.004","journalAbbreviation":"Information Fusion","ISSN":"1566-2535","creators":[{"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianrui","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Luo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hongmei","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junbo","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dexian","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zeng","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cluster ensembles","type":1},{"tag":"Homogeneous and heterogeneous MSIF","type":1},{"tag":"Incremental learning","type":1},{"tag":"Multi-source information fusion","type":1},{"tag":"Multi-view rough sets","type":1},{"tag":"Parallel computing","type":1},{"tag":"Rough set theory","type":1}],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T00:59:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QYI5EVIG","itemID":339,"attachments":[{"key":"M696M88B","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Zhang2021.md","parentItem":"QYI5EVIG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Zhang2021.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T01:07:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-05T01:07:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/M696M88B","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\M696M88B\\@Zhang2021.md","defaultPath":"files/1086/@Zhang2021.md"},{"key":"567FT36S","version":6035,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Multi-source information fusion based on rough set theory.pdf","parentItem":"QYI5EVIG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Multi-source information fusion based on rough set theory.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Although as an engine its thermal efﬁciency is relatively poor, as a heat transfer device it can transfer a relatively large quantity of heat against gravity, without a wicking material or any moving parts. The thermal and ﬂuid dynamic equations are given whereby the device may be mathematically modelled. Computer-generated results for thrust, pressure and temperature as a function of time are given and discussed. Comparing the theoretical with experimentally obtained thrust curves, it is concluded that the mathematical model reﬂects the physical behaviour of the device reasonably well. Limitations of the present model are discussed and it is recommended that the device should ﬁnd application in heat transfer rather than as an engine.","date":"10/2003","language":"en","archive":"Q2","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.7227/IJMEE.31.4.5","accessDate":"2022-12-07T01:40:18Z","rights":"0.0000","extra":"Citation Key: dobson2003open","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"31","pages":"339-358","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education","DOI":"10.7227/IJMEE.31.4.5","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Mech Eng Educ","ISSN":"0306-4190, 2050-4586","creators":[{"firstName":"R.

The state-of-the-art study focuses on near-miss collision risk between/among ships but reveals challenges in estimating large-scale traffic situations associated with dynamic and uncertain ship motions at a regional level. This study develops a systematic methodology to evaluate ship traffic complexity to comprehend the traffic situation in complex waters. In the new methodology, the topological and evolutionary characteristics of ship traffic networks and the uncertainty in ship movements are considered simultaneously to realise probabilistic collision detection. The methodology, through the effective integration of probabilistic conflict estimation and traffic complexity modelling and assessment, enables the evaluation of traffic complexity in a fine-grained hierarchical manner. With the AIS-based trajectory data collected from the world’s largest port (i.e. Ningbo-Zhoushan Port), a thorough validation of the evaluation performance is conducted and demonstrated through scenario analysis and model robustness. Moreover, some critical research results are obtained in terms of traffic network heterogeneity analysis; statistics including occurrence frequency, temporal distribution, life cycle, and transition probability of traffic complexity patterns; and correlation examination between the number of ships and traffic complexity patterns. These findings offer new insights into improving maritime traffic awareness capabilities and promoting maritime traffic safety management.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742201908X","extra":"Citation Key: xin2023multistage","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"213","pages":"118890","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118890","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Xuri","lastName":"Xin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zaili","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kezhong","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jinfen","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaolie","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"AIS data"},{"tag":"Maritime risk"},{"tag":"Network topology"},{"tag":"Ship traffic complexity"},{"tag":"Situation evolution"},{"tag":"Spatial-temporal traffic dynamics"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/R4YN3E4Y","itemID":1417,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495049,"version":0},"$loki":1452},{"itemID":31,"item":{"key":"RBJDXSUD","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Deng entropy","date":"10/2016","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960077916302363","accessDate":"2022-09-18T14:14:56Z","extra":"Citation Key: deng2016deng","volume":"91","pages":"549-553","publicationTitle":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"10.1016/j.chaos.2016.07.014","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","ISSN":"09600779","creators":[{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["BQBMCBIR","DABM6HNP"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LLQSHDE7"]},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:14:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/RBJDXSUD","itemID":31,"attachments":[{"key":"B7W8VJGS","version":6,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Deng2016.md","parentItem":"RBJDXSUD","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Deng2016.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:24:37Z","dateModified":"2022-09-18T14:24:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/B7W8VJGS","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Deng2016.md","defaultPath":"files/42/@Deng2016.md"},{"key":"CJ9Z2REG","version":6044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2016-Deng entropy.pdf","parentItem":"RBJDXSUD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2016-Deng entropy.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

The analysis of the experimental results showed two kind of operating curves (overall thermal resistance vs. heat rate): for low heat ﬂuxes, the curve is irregular and the PHP performance is sensitive to the orientation. For high heat ﬂuxes, the operating curve is smooth and independent from the orientation. To contribute to the analysis of these results, experiments were conducted at the scale of a single branch of a PHP. An oscillating motion was imposed to a single liquid plug surrounded by two vapour slugs in a capillary tube and high speed visualizations were performed. The test section was either adiabatic or heated. The adiabatic experiments brought to the fore the importance of dynamic contact angles in the ﬂow and the dissymmetry between the advancing and receding contact angle. The non-adiabatic experiments showed that at low ﬂux, the ﬂow is disturbed by bubble nucleation, while at high heat ﬂux, the main heat transfer mechanism is thin ﬁlm evaporation, with a completely different thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour.","date":"6/2010","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"6.4650","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359431110000037","accessDate":"2022-12-16T14:24:47Z","rights":"5.906","extra":"Citation Key: lips2010experimental","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"30","pages":"900-907","publicationTitle":"Applied Thermal Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2009.12.020","issue":"8-9","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Appl Therm Eng","ISSN":"13594311","creators":[{"firstName":"Stéphane","lastName":"Lips","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ahlem","lastName":"Bensalem","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Bertin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Ayel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Romestant","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Bonjour","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-16T14:24:47Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/RJC4K434","itemID":690,"attachments":[{"key":"JPGJV894","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2010-Experimental evidences of distinct heat transfer regimes in pulsating heat.pdf","parentItem":"RJC4K434","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2010-Experimental evidences of distinct heat transfer regimes in pulsating heat.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Due to its unpredictability and destructiveness, the emergency has aroused great common in society. At the same time, the selection of emergency medical supplier is one of the critical links in emergency decision-making, so undertaking appropriate decision-making using scientific tools becomes the primary challenge when an emergency outbreak occurs. The multi criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method is an applicable and common method for choosing supplier. Nevertheless, because emergency medical supplier selection should consider regarding many aspects, it is difficult for decision makers (DMs) to develop a comprehensive assessment method for emergency medical supplier. Therefore, few academics have focused on emergency situation research by the MCGDM method, and the existing MCGDM method has some areas for improvement. In view of this situation, in this study, we propose a new MCGDM method, which considers the bidirectional influence relation of the criteria, consensus and the psychological factors of DMs. It providers a good aid in emergency decision-making and it could apply to other types of MCGDM research. Firstly, DMs give their assessment in interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). Secondly, an extended IT2FSs assessment method and a novel ISM-BWM-Cosine Similarity-Max Deviation Method (IBCSMDM) are used for weighing all alternatives. The TODIM (an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making in Portuguese) can obtain the ranking results under different risk attenuation factors. Eventually, this extended IT2FSs-IBCSMDM-TODIM method is applied in a real case in Wuhan in the context of COVID-19 to illustrate the practicability and usefulness.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422007552","extra":"Citation Key: liu2022extended","volume":"202","pages":"117414","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117414","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"He","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix T.S.","lastName":"Chan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bidirectional Influence Relation"},{"tag":"Emergency Medical Supplier"},{"tag":"Fuzzy Logic"},{"tag":"MCGDM"},{"tag":"Psychological Factors"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/S7WNXFMW","itemID":1467,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495148,"version":0},"$loki":1461},{"itemID":1448,"item":{"key":"S8BDDLUG","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evidential reasoning for preprocessing uncertain categorical data for trustworthy decisions: An application on healthcare and finance","abstractNote":"The uncertainty attributed by discrepant data in AI-enabled decisions is a critical challenge in highly regulated domains such as health care and finance.

This paper addresses the challenges in handling categorical attributes as it is not addressed comprehensively in previous research. Three sources of uncertainties in categorical attributes are recognised in this research. The informational uncertainty, unforeseeable uncertainty in the decision task environment, and the uncertainty due to lack of pre-modelling explainability in categorical attributes are addressed in the proposed methodology on maximum likelihood evidential reasoning (MAKER). It can transform and impute incomplete and ambiguous categorical attributes into interpretable numerical features. It utilises a notion of weight and reliability to include subjective expert preference over a piece of evidence and the quality of evidence in a categorical attribute, respectively. The MAKER framework strives to integrate the recognised uncertainties in the transformed input data that allow a model to perceive data limitations during the training regime and acknowledge doubtful predictions by supporting trustworthy pre-modelling and post modelling explainability. The ability to handle uncertainty and its impact on explainability is demonstrated on a real-world healthcare and finance data for different missing data scenarios in three types of AI algorithms: deep-learning, tree-based, and rule-based model.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009970","extra":"Citation Key: sachan2021evidential","volume":"185","pages":"115597","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115597","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Swati","lastName":"Sachan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fatima","lastName":"Almaghrabi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong-Ling","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Uncertainty"},{"tag":"Categorical"},{"tag":"Decision-making"},{"tag":"Evidential reasoning"},{"tag":"Trustworthy"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/S8BDDLUG","itemID":1448,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495151,"version":0},"$loki":1462},{"itemID":442,"item":{"key":"SDANTVIK","version":5497,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A novel quantum model of mass function for uncertain information fusion","abstractNote":"Understanding the uncertainty involved in a mass function is a central issue in Dempster–Shafer evidence theory for uncertain information fusion. Recent advances suggest to interpret the mass function from a view of quantum theory. However, existing studies do not truly implement the quantization of evidence. In order to solve the problem, a usable quantization scheme for mass function is studied in this paper. At first, a novel quantum model of mass function is proposed, which effectively embodies the principle of quantum superposition. Then, a quantum averaging operator is designed to obtain the quantum average of evidence, which not only retains many basic properties, for example idempotency, commutativity, and quasi-associativity, required by a rational approach for uncertain information fusion, but also yields some new characters, namely nonlinearity and globality, caused by the quantization of mass functions. At last, based on the quantum averaging operator, a new rule called quantum average combination rule is developed for the fusion of multiple pieces of evidence, which is compared with other representative average-based combination methods to show its performance. Numerical examples and applications for classification tasks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantum model, averaging operator, and combination rule.","date":"01/2023","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1566253522001294","accessDate":"2022-11-16T02:47:10Z","extra":"Citation Key: deng2023novel","volume":"89","pages":"619-631","publicationTitle":"Information Fusion","DOI":"10.1016/j.inffus.2022.08.030","journalAbbreviation":"Information Fusion","ISSN":"15662535","creators":[{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"Xue","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T02:47:10Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/SDANTVIK","itemID":442,"attachments":[{"key":"ZDFPJRNI","version":6044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2023-A novel quantum model of mass function for uncertain information fusion.pdf","parentItem":"SDANTVIK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2023-A novel quantum model of mass function for uncertain information fusion.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

In order to utilize BPA to practical decision-making, pignistic probability transformation of BPA is a significant method. In the paper, we simulate the pignistic probability transformation (PPT) process based on the fractal idea, which describes PPT process in detail and shows the process of information volume changes during transformation intuitively. Based on transformation process, we propose a new belief entropy called fractal-based belief (FB) entropy.

videos of an unfamiliar dog (tranquil and active) on subjective mental state measures. All participants watched two videos of an unfamiliar dog (tranquil and active). Subjective measures of stress, anxiety, alertness, attention, likeability, and cuteness were assessed. The results showed that the tranquil dog video significantly decreased anxiety only. Additionally, the active dog video significantly decreased stress and anxiety. Across the videos, the results showed the active dog video significantly improved subjective alertness and attention when compared with the tranquil dog video. Lastly, the active dog video was rated more likeable and cuter relative to the tranquil dog video. The practical implications of these findings could include how to improve various subjective mental states for humans in public settings (e.g., hospital) where nonhuman animals are not always allowed.","date":"2020-07-07","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://brill.com/view/journals/soan/30/4/article-p445_6.xml","accessDate":"2022-11-01T13:00:43Z","extra":"Citation Key: Ein2020","volume":"30","pages":"445-460","publicationTitle":"Society & Animals","DOI":"10.1163/15685306-BJA10019","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Soc.

Sub-cooled water enters the pipe from the lower end and heats up ﬁrst in the near wall region leading to the generation of small bubbles. Further along the pipe larger and larger bubbles are generated by coalescence and evaporation. This leads to transitions of the two-phase ﬂow patterns from bubbly to churn-turbulent and annular ﬂow. The CFD simulation bases on the recently developed GEneralized TwO Phase ﬂow (GENTOP) concept. It is a multi-ﬁeld model using the Euler-Euler approach. It allows the consideration of different local ﬂow morphologies including transitions between them. Small steam bubbles are handled as dispersed phases while the interface of large gas structures is statistically resolved. The paper presents the extension of the GENTOP model for phase transfer and discusses the sub-models used. Finally the above mentioned boiling pipe is considered as demonstration case.","date":"10/2017","language":"en","archive":"Q2","archiveLocation":"工程技术3区","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"1.9002","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0029549317303199","accessDate":"2022-12-16T13:32:44Z","rights":"1.972","extra":"Citation Key: hohne2017cfdsimulation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"322","pages":"165-176","publicationTitle":"Nuclear Engineering and Design","DOI":"10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.06.047","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Nucl Eng Des","ISSN":"00295493","creators":[{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Höhne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E.","lastName":"Krepper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Montoya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Lucas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-16T13:32:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TIAZ9QD2","itemID":673,"attachments":[{"key":"3ZTCGL7M","version":6042,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2017-CFD-simulation of boiling in a heated pipe including flow pattern transitions.pdf","parentItem":"TIAZ9QD2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017-CFD-simulation of boiling in a heated pipe including flow pattern transitions.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

We examine theoretical perspectives and empirical findings about data and information privacy grouped according to privacy’s role in society, the psychology of privacy, and the economics of privacy. Although a coherent subset of research themes provide deep understanding, theoretical and empirical findings show this narrow focus also has constrained our view of privacy to consumer, organizational, ethical, or legal silos. In response, we take a necessary step toward expanding the privacy domain across these borders, emphasizing the compelling synergies that span multiple interests. We conclude by highlighting future research themes that embody a multidimensional approach, which blends the many interconnected concerns that feature in contemporary privacy questions in marketing. Since internal and external stakeholders are affected in multiple and potentially unforeseen ways by data privacy issues, additional work in this space remains critical and needed.","date":"3/2017","language":"en","archive":"Q1","callNumber":"14.9033","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11747-016-0495-4","accessDate":"2023-04-29T14:16:18Z","rights":"17.9930","extra":"Citation Key: martin2017role","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"45","pages":"135-155","publicationTitle":"Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science","DOI":"10.1007/s11747-016-0495-4","issue":"2","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"J Acad Market Sci","ISSN":"0092-0703, 1552-7824","creators":[{"firstName":"Kelly D.","lastName":"Martin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick E.","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T14:16:18Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T14:16:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TKS32DYW","itemID":1546,"attachments":[{"key":"8R69I77G","version":6052,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2017-The role of data privacy in marketing.pdf","parentItem":"TKS32DYW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017-The role of data privacy in marketing.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T14:16:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T14:17:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/8R69I77G","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\8R69I77G\\2017-The role of data privacy in marketing.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1545/2017-The role of data privacy in marketing.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495199,"version":0},"$loki":1472},{"itemID":448,"item":{"key":"TKX8DJB3","version":5497,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Bifurcation analysis of bubble-induced convection in a horizontal liquid layer: role of forces on bubbles","abstractNote":"Abstract\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              We investigate with a two-fluid model the convections developing in a gas–liquid two-phase flow, which consists of a horizontal liquid layer subject to the injection of monodisperse gas bubbles at the bottom. The convections develop in either whole- or multi-layered modes, once the gas injection flux exceeds a critical value (Nakamura\n              et al.\n              ,\n              Phys. Rev.\n              E, vol. 102, 2020, 053102). We determine the nonlinear evolution of these modes of flows with varying injection flux and find that the whole- and multi-layered modes develop through subcritical and supercritical bifurcations, respectively. The formation of gas plumes is observed in both cases when the nonlinearity is significant. Examining energy transfer from base to perturbation flows, we show that the lift forces on bubbles play a key role in the bifurcations. While they impede the convections in both subcritical and supercritical bifurcations at weak nonlinearity, the lift forces turn to driving the convections in the subcritical bifurcation as nonlinearity increases.","date":"2021-09-25","language":"en","shortTitle":"Bifurcation analysis of bubble-induced convection in a horizontal liquid layer","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0022112021006017/type/journal_article","accessDate":"2022-11-17T10:05:35Z","extra":"Citation Key: nakamura2021bifurcation","volume":"923","pages":"R4","publicationTitle":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2021.601","journalAbbreviation":"J.

An important feature of RPS theory is that in the fusion rule of RPS sources, the fusion order has a great impact on fusion results. However, how to determine the fusion order has not yet been discussed. To address this problem, this paper first proposes Permutation Jensen–Shannon (PJS) divergence for measuring the distance between two RPSs. Based on PJS divergence, a new Reliability Assessment algorithm, named RAPJS, is then presented for determining the fusion order of RPSs. The proposed PJS divergence satisfies the properties of non–degeneracy, boundary, and symmetry, and has desirable compatibility with Belief Jensen–Shannon divergence and Jensen–Shannon divergence under certain conditions. The presented RAPJS makes use of the divergence information to calculate the reliability degree of RPS sources, the RPS with a higher reliability is fused first. Experiment results in threat assessment reveal that the presented RAPJS algorithm can determine the fusion order reasonably and effectively. The assessment results using the proposed RAPJS algorithm has the highest target recognition rate compared to other results under different fusion orders.","date":"03/2023","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术2区","libraryCatalog":"自动化与控制系统3区  计算机：人工智能3区  工程：电子与电气2区  工程：综合2区","callNumber":"7.8024","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197622006911","accessDate":"2023-04-26T08:57:05Z","rights":"6.6936","extra":"Citation Key: chen2023permutation","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"119","pages":"105701","publicationTitle":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105701","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Eng Appl Artif Intel","ISSN":"09521976","creators":[{"firstName":"Luyuan","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kang Hao","lastName":"Cheong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BQBMCBIR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-26T08:57:05Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TRPDFXJQ","itemID":1486,"attachments":[{"key":"QDMJT2GD","version":6055,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2023-Permutation Jensen–Shannon divergence for Random Permutation Set.pdf","parentItem":"TRPDFXJQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2023-Permutation Jensen–Shannon divergence for Random Permutation Set.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-26T08:56:53Z","dateModified":"2023-04-26T08:57:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QDMJT2GD","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\QDMJT2GD\\2023-Permutation Jensen–Shannon divergence for Random Permutation Set.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1485/2023-Permutation Jensen–Shannon divergence for Random Permutation Set.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495216,"version":0},"$loki":1475},{"itemID":1451,"item":{"key":"TZIPNCRD","version":5514,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dempster-shafer theory and linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy number-based framework for blending knowledge from knowledge repositories: An approach for knowledge management","abstractNote":"Based on Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET) and Linguistic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers (LIFN), this study presents a paradigm for Knowledge Blending (KB) that supports the Knowledge Management (KM) process. The KB framework highlights and analyzes knowledge blending, the emergence of new insights, the ordering of knowledge repositories, and selected knowledge entities that are part of such a knowledge combination. The KB method enables the analysis of knowledge repositories using linguistic terms and quantitative variables and the identification of the ordering of knowledge repositories and specific entities. Ordering knowledge repositories and entities during KB is tricky since knowledge providers employ a range of adjectives, rankings, interpretations, and linguistic terms, rendering the KB process ambiguous. To address the issue, we leverage DSET to describe the LIFNs extracted from knowledge sources as Basic Probability Assignments (BPA). Then, we merge subjective and objective weights obtained from knowledge repositories. To amend evidence from knowledge repositories, we apply the combined weight. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation value of each option is quantified using the combination rule of evidence, which aids in the blending of knowledge repositories and entities acquired from the knowledge repositories. We discuss a case study to explain the proposed method and compare it to other approaches in order to demonstrate its viability and usefulness. The case study highlights the value of KM during the knowledge structuring and auditing stages of the KM process.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005383","extra":"Citation Key: anjaria2022dempstershafer","volume":"199","pages":"117142","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117142","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Kushal","lastName":"Anjaria","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-shafer evidence theory"},{"tag":"Knowledge blending"},{"tag":"Knowledge management"},{"tag":"Linguistic Intuitionistic fuzzy number"},{"tag":"Weight combination"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/TZIPNCRD","itemID":1451,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495220,"version":0},"$loki":1476},{"itemID":1240,"item":{"key":"U3T8IVAG","version":5506,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fuzzy sets","date":"1965","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: zadeh1965fuzzy","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"8","pages":"338–353","publicationTitle":"Information and control","issue":"3","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Information and control","creators":[{"firstName":"Lotfi A","lastName":"Zadeh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T04:04:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/U3T8IVAG","itemID":1240,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495223,"version":0},"$loki":1477},{"itemID":1352,"item":{"key":"U5GXJES9","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Fractional deng entropy and extropy and some applications","date":"2021","extra":"Publisher: MDPI\nCitation Key: kazemi2021fractional","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"23","pages":"623","publicationTitle":"Entropy.

Low-contrast can result from foggy weather conditions during image acquisition. Dehazing is a process of removal of haze from the photography of a hazy scene. Single-image dehazing based on dark channel priors are well-known techniques in this field. However, the performance of such techniques is limited to priors or constraints. Moreover, this type of method fails when images have sky-region. So, a method is proposed, which can restore the visibility of hazy images. First, a hazy image is divided into blocks of size 32 × 32, then the score of each block is calculated to select a block having the highest score. Atmospheric light is calculated from the selected block. A new color channel is considered to remove atmospheric scattering, obtained channel value and atmospheric light are then used to calculate the transmission map in the second step. Third, radiance is computed using a transmission map and atmospheric light. The illumination scaling factor is adopted to enhance the quality of a dehazed image in the final step. Experiments are performed on six datasets namely, I-HAZE, O-HAZE, BSDS500, FRIDA, RESIDE dataset and natural images from Google. The proposed method is compared against 11 state-of-the-art methods. The performance is analyzed using fourteen quantitative evaluation metrics. All the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in most of the cases.","date":"01/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"2.8869","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1047320320302212","accessDate":"2023-03-21T02:29:58Z","rights":"2.7112","extra":"Citation Key: sahu2021single","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"74","pages":"103008","publicationTitle":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2020.103008","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"J Vis Commun Image R","ISSN":"10473203","creators":[{"firstName":"Geet","lastName":"Sahu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayan","lastName":"Seal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Krejcar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Yazidi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"haze removal"},{"tag":"image enhancement"},{"tag":"single-image dehazing"}],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:29:58Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UJV8ISVE","itemID":1010,"attachments":[{"key":"KY2ET6IU","version":6037,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-Single image dehazing using a new color channel.pdf","parentItem":"UJV8ISVE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-Single image dehazing using a new color channel.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/1\">Introduction</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/3\">Material and method</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/3\">DCP method</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/4\">DCP based methods</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/4\">Proposed work</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/4\">Atmospheric light</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/5\">Transmission map</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/6\">Radiance</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/9\">Enhancement</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/10\">Experimental results and discussion</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/10\">Database description</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/10\">Computational protocols</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/11\">Results and comparison</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/14\">Conclusion</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/15\">Acknowledgments</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/15\">Declaration of competing interest</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_VK3LRXTL/15\">References</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-21T02:31:10Z","dateModified":"2023-03-21T02:31:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KY2ET6IU","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\KY2ET6IU\\2021-Single image dehazing using a new color channel.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1105/2021-Single image dehazing using a new color channel.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495405,"version":0},"$loki":1481},{"itemID":182,"item":{"key":"ULPMCV2M","version":5493,"itemType":"preprint","title":"The Effect of kawaii on task performance: Viewing cute images without baby schema","abstractNote":"Even though the word “kawaii” (cute) has become more broadly defined in recent years in Japan, almost all research on cuteness has used the baby schema as a stimulus. Based on the finding that feelings of cuteness toward the baby schema improves task performance (Sherman et al., 2009), this study will investigate the effect on task performance of feelings of cuteness toward things which don’t have the baby schema. Eighty-two university students were presented with cute images without a baby schema and noncute images. Before and afterwards, they were asked to carry out fine motor dexterity task and visual search task. Performing a two-way ANOVA, taking the number of successful trials as task performance, showed that performance was significantly improved after the presentation of cute images. This suggests that feelings of cuteness toward things without a baby schema may elicit approach motivation, leading to improved performance. Because feelings of cuteness with a baby schema increase discretion, we may consider the possibility that these results show a unique effect toward cute things without a baby schema.","date":"三月 16,

management in learning organizations. The present work considers the surrounding factors of information to enumerate the effectiveness of information in the knowledge management field. Moreover, by utilizing the effectiveness of surrounding factors, a framework inspired by Dempster-Shafer theory has been presented to generate negation. Finally, the present paper defines and calculates entropy for information. We have applied negation and entropy concepts to two well-known cases of organizational systems and management domains to study their impact on the knowledge management domain. The cases have supported our decisions taken after the calculation of proposed negation and entropy concepts. The proposed method has a quality interpretation of the information operators and has the merit of simplifying knowledge management and decision making problems in the context of a learning organization. The present study combines multiple aspects of knowledge management, organizational systems, decision making, and organizational learning.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420303213","extra":"Citation Key: anjaria2020negationa","volume":"157","pages":"113497","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113497","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Kushal","lastName":"Anjaria","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Decision making"},{"tag":"Entropy"},{"tag":"Knowledge management"},{"tag":"Learning organization"},{"tag":"Negation"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42","444KMZK3"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5MSF2M3Z"]},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:39:43Z","dateModified":"2023-05-03T10:58:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UXAD2XSL","itemID":1477,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495502,"version":0},"$loki":1486},{"itemID":1481,"item":{"key":"UZV24N5W","version":5517,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Providing a greater precision of Situational Awareness of urban floods through Multimodal Fusion","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742101277X","extra":"Citation Key: dacosta2022providing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"188","pages":"115923","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115923","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Thiago Aparecido Gonçalves","lastName":"da Costa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rodolfo Ipolito","lastName":"Meneguette","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jó","lastName":"Ueyama","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Disaster management"},{"tag":"Floods"},{"tag":"Multimodal fusion"},{"tag":"Situational awareness"},{"tag":"Text classification"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:58:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/UZV24N5W","itemID":1481,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495509,"version":0},"$loki":1487},{"itemID":1475,"item":{"key":"VFJYWV7U","version":5516,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evidence-based decision-making: On the use of systematicity cases to check the compliance of reviews with reporting guidelines such as PRISMA 2020","abstractNote":"Background and context Systematic reviews aim to provide high-quality evidence-based syntheses for efficacy under real-world conditions and allow understanding the correlations between exposures and outcomes. They are increasingly popular and have several stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, researchers, educators, students, journal editors, policy makers, managers) to whom they help make informed recommendations for practice or policy. Problem Systematic reviews usually exhibit low methodological and reporting quality. To tackle this, reporting guidelines have been developed to support systematic reviews reporting and assessment. Following such guidelines is crucial to ensure that a review is transparent, complete, trustworthy, reproducible, and unbiased. However, systematic reviewers usually fail to adhere to existing reporting guidelines, which may significantly decrease the quality of the reviews they report and may result in systematic reviews that lack methodological rigor, yield low-credible findings and may mislead decision-makers. Methods To assure that a review complies with reporting guidelines, we rely on assurance cases that are an emerging way of arguing and relaying various safety–critical systems’ requirements in an extensive manner, as well as checking the compliance of such systems with standards to support their certification. Since the nature of assurance cases makes them applicable to various domains and requirements/properties, we therefore propose a new type of assurance cases called systematicity cases. Systematicity cases focus on the systematicity property and allow arguing that a review is systematic i.e., that it sufficiently complies with the targeted reporting guideline. The most widespread reporting guidelines include PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses). We measure the confidence in a systematicity case representing a review as a means to quantify the systematicity of that review i.e., the extent to which that review is systematic. We rely on rule-based Artificial Intelligence to create a knowledge-based system that automatically supports the inference mechanism that a given systematicity case embodies and that allows making a decision regarding the systematicity of a given review. Results An empirical evaluation performed on 25 reviews (self-identifying as systematic) showed that these reviews exhibit a suboptimal systematicity. More specifically, the systematicity of the analyzed reviews varies between 32.96% and 66.49% and its average is 54.42%. More efforts are therefore needed to report systematic reviews of higher quality. More experiments are also needed to further explore the factors hindering and/or assuring the systematicity of reviews. Audience The main beneficiaries of our work are journal reviewers, journal editors, managers, policymakers, researchers, organizations developing reporting guidelines, peer reviewers, students, insurers, evidence users, as well as reporting guidelines developers.","date":"2023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423000702","extra":"Citation Key: boayebelle2023evidencebased","volume":"217","pages":"119569","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119569","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Alvine","lastName":"Boaye Belle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yixi","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Artificial intelligence"},{"tag":"Assurance cases (systematicity cases)"},{"tag":"Knowledge representation and reasoning"},{"tag":"Knowledge-based systems"},{"tag":"PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses) statement"},{"tag":"Reporting guideline adherence"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:49Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/VFJYWV7U","itemID":1475,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117495522,"version":0},"$loki":1488},{"itemID":646,"item":{"key":"VFZL3YCM","version":5500,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"CFD modelling of a two-phase closed thermosyphon charged with R134a and R404a","abstractNote":"This paper examines the application of CFD modelling to simulate the two-phase heat transfer mechanisms in a wickless heat pipe, also called a thermosyphon.

Being able to support and sometimes substitute experts, an expert system may be a precious ally for medical diagnoses. Medical expert system applications provide physicians and patients with an immediate access to knowledge and advice, rooting their flexibility into their knowledge bases, rule sets and graphical interfaces. To be trusted by their users, medical expert systems should follow some criteria, which we investigate along with their different realization, from fuzzy logic to wearable solutions for out-of-clinical-environment care. We also consider the advantages of approaching diagnoses and alert systems through an artificial intelligence counterpart, without forgetting the importance of a good validation to assess the system functionality. Therefore, we show the heterogeneity of the solutions proposed by the literature, bounded to the specific needs a medical expert system is called to answer, the common lack of a system validation and the possible benefits deriving from these systems application.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421003419","extra":"Citation Key:

In this work, we investigate the methodologies and applications of 3D HAR primarily using the depth modality through a study of the end-to-end process of the state-of-the-art techniques . Challenges, future directions, availability of the datasets, and critical analysis regarding existing methods constitute a part of this paper.

Dempster–Shafer theory for developing a flexible, accurate and interpretable classifier","abstractNote":"Two approaches have traditionally been identified for developing artificial intelligence systems supporting decision-making: Machine Learning, which applies general techniques based on statistical analysis and optimization methods to extract information from a large amount of data looking for possible relations among them, and Expert Systems, which codify experts knowledge in rules, which are then applied to a specific situation. One of the main advantages of the first approach is its greater accuracy and wider generality for the application of the methods developed which can be used in various scenarios. By contrast, expert systems are usually more restricted and often applicable only to the domain for which they were originally developed. However, the machine learning approach requires the availability of large chunks of data, and it is much more complicated to interpret the results of the statistical methods to obtain some explanation of why the system decides, classifies, or evaluates a situation in a certain way. This issue may become very important in areas such as medicine, where it is relevant to know why the system recommends a certain treatment or diagnoses a certain illness. Likewise, in the financial sector, it might be legally required to explain that a decision to reject the granting of a mortgage loan to a person is not due to discriminatory causes such as gender or race. In order to be able to have interpretability and extract knowledge of available data we developed a classification method based on Dempster-Shafer’s Plausibility Theory. Mass assignment functions (MAF) must be established to apply this theory and they assign a weight or probability to all subsets of the possible outcomes, given the presence of a certain fact on a decision scenario. Thus MAF assignments encode expert knowledge. The method learns optimal values for the weights of each MAF using the Gradient Descent method. The presented method allows combination of MAF which have been generated by the method itself or defined by an expert with those that are derived from a set of available data. The developed method was first applied to controlled scenarios and traditional data sets to ensure that classifications and explanations are correct. Results show that the model can classify with an accuracy which is comparable to other statistical classification methods, being also able to extract the most important decision rules from the data.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420300877","extra":"Citation Key: penafiel2020applying","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"148","pages":"113262","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113262","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Peñafiel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Baloian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Horacio","lastName":"Sanson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José A.","lastName":"Pino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dempster-Shafer theory"},{"tag":"Expert systems"},{"tag":"Gradient descent"},{"tag":"Interpretability"},{"tag":"Supervised learning"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:43Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/X8HW2N74","itemID":1413,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496169,"version":0},"$loki":1506},{"itemID":1409,"item":{"key":"XHTJJ444","version":5510,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evaluation of fuzzy membership functions for linguistic rule-based classifier focused on explainability, interpretability and reliability","abstractNote":"Objective: Decision support systems focus on their interpretability with a different caution. The majority of approaches utilize reliable optimization techniques to achieve high recognition accuracy. However, accuracy improvement is done at the cost of the readability of the decision support system. This paper proposes a novel technique of linguistic rule extraction focused on: explainability, interpretability, and reliability, called EasIeR. Methods: Proposed solution performs a direct analysis of the learning set without omitting real data imperfections. The proposed algorithm processes the imprecision of data with linguistic values described by fuzzy membership functions and the uncertainty of knowledge employing a fuzzy belief function. It describes the learning set with the most appropriate fuzzy if-then rules. For this purpose, a new method of evaluation of membership functions in a set of rules and their iterative refinement is proposed. Results: EasIeR achieves the best results of trade-off criteria between the generalization quality and the interpretability of the knowledge base when compared with state-of-art fuzzy rule-based classification approaches. Achieving the simplest rule base and competitive generalization quality is verified by cross-validation experiments with benchmark data sets. Significance: The new method of rule evaluation allows for better determination of their quality in decision support, and the selection algorithm quickly provides a clear and easy to interpret knowledge base. This rule evaluation technique will be proficient for all fuzzy rule-based classification systems.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005164","extra":"Citation Key:

tweet impact using a novel evidential reasoning prediction method","abstractNote":"This study presents a novel evidential reasoning (ER) prediction model called MAKER-RIMER to examine how different features embedded in Twitter posts (tweets) can predict the number of retweets achieved during an electoral campaign. The tweets posted by the two most voted candidates during the official campaign for the 2017 Ecuadorian Presidential election were used for this research. For each tweet, five features including type of tweet, emotion, URL, hashtag, and date are identified and coded to predict if tweets are of either high or low impact. The main contributions of the new proposed model include its suitability to analyse tweet datasets based on likelihood analysis of data. The model is interpretable, and the prediction process relies only on the use of available data. The experimental results show that MAKER-RIMER performed better, in terms of misclassification error, when compared against other predictive machine learning approaches. In addition, the model allows observing which features of the candidates’ tweets are linked to high and low impact. Tweets containing allusions to the contender candidate, either with positive or negative connotations, without hashtags, and written towards the end of the campaign, were persistently those with the highest impact. URLs, on the other hand, is the only variable that performs differently for the two candidates in terms of achieving high impact. MAKER-RIMER can provide campaigners of political parties or candidates with a tool to measure how features of tweets are predictors of their impact, which can be useful to tailor Twitter content during electoral campaigns.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420310721","extra":"Citation Key: rivadeneira2021predicting","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"169","pages":"114400","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114400","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Lucía","lastName":"Rivadeneira","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian-Bo","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"López-Ibáñez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Belief rule-based inference"},{"tag":"Evidential reasoning rule"},{"tag":"Maximum likelihood data analysis"},{"tag":"Prediction"},{"tag":"Retweet"},{"tag":"Twitter"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:56:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XWFY5GPP","itemID":1421,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496346,"version":0},"$loki":1512},{"itemID":1361,"item":{"key":"Y8AXAHW3","version":5509,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Atmospheric light estimation through vector orthogonality in color degradation space","abstractNote":"Atmospheric light estimation is fundamental for image or video dehazing. Unlike previous researches on the atmospheric light estimation, this study reveals a vector orthogonality in the classical atmospheric color degradation model for the first time. It is demonstrated that atmospheric light vector is orthogonal to the normal vectors of color degradation plane. Furthermore, a novel estimation method for direction and magnitude of atmospheric light vector is proposed based on the vector orthogonality. The proposed method can accurately estimate the atmospheric light and improve the quality of image dehazing with a short constant processing time even if the image resolution is increasing. This study provides an efficient approach for estimating atmospheric light for high-definition image or video dehazing applications, such as traffic surveillance, environmental monitoring, and aerial photography.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","extra":"Citation Key: kongatmospheric","seriesTitle":"无","seriesText":"无","creators":[{"firstName":"Lingzhao","lastName":"Kong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dagang","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["KVHBPU4U"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-05T05:03:30Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:09:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Y8AXAHW3","itemID":1361,"attachments":[{"key":"SA6CYWQH","version":6049,"itemType":"attachment","title":"-Atmospheric light estimation through vector orthogonality in color degradation.pdf","parentItem":"Y8AXAHW3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"-Atmospheric light estimation through vector orthogonality in color degradation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-05T05:03:25Z","dateModified":"2023-04-05T05:03:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/SA6CYWQH","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\SA6CYWQH\\-Atmospheric light estimation through vector orthogonality in color degradation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1360/-Atmospheric light estimation through vector orthogonality in color degradation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496352,"version":0},"$loki":1513},{"itemID":30,"item":{"key":"Y8CI63LU","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions","abstractNote":"The study of alternative combination rules in DS theory when evidence is in conﬂict has emerged again recently as an interesting topic, especially in data/information fusion applications. These studies have mainly focused on investigating which alternative would be appropriate for which conﬂicting situation, under the assumption that a conﬂict is identiﬁed. The issue of detection (or identiﬁcation) of conﬂict among evidence has been ignored. In this paper, we formally deﬁne when two basic belief assignments are in conﬂict. This deﬁnition deploys quantitative measures of both the mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset before normalization and the distance between betting commitments of beliefs. We argue that only when both measures are high, it is safe to say the evidence is in conﬂict. This deﬁnition can be served as a prerequisite for selecting appropriate combination rules.","date":"08/2006","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0004370206000658","accessDate":"2022-09-18T14:14:46Z","extra":"Citation Key: liu2006analyzing","volume":"170","pages":"909-924","publicationTitle":"Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.artint.2006.05.002","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"00043702","creators":[{"firstName":"Weiru","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DABM6HNP"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/2KBDSHEN","http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/5RTFC2GC","http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/W3WZCU3H"]},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:14:46Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Y8CI63LU","itemID":30,"attachments":[{"key":"JWKB875R","version":5,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Liu2006.md","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Liu2006.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-18T14:24:17Z","dateModified":"2022-09-18T14:24:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JWKB875R","localPath":"C:\\Users\\Jeffey\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\Obsidian Sync\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\@Liu2006.md","defaultPath":"files/38/@Liu2006.md"},{"key":"JQZFL9VN","version":3773,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:08:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:21:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/JQZFL9VN","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/286/2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions2.pdf"},{"key":"GFKU2WRX","version":3773,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:08:57Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:21:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/GFKU2WRX","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf","defaultPath":"files/287/2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions3.pdf"},{"key":"LW6G3ZS4","version":6040,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","parentItem":"Y8CI63LU","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/PU27VB9Q"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-04T08:00:25Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T01:21:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/LW6G3ZS4","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\LW6G3ZS4\\2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1138/2006-Analyzing the degree of conflict among belief functions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496367,"version":0},"$loki":1514},{"itemID":856,"item":{"key":"Y8ES2UW5","version":5502,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing the monotonicity of belief interval based uncertainty measures in belief function theory","abstractNote":"Measuring the uncertainty of pieces of evidence is an open issue in belief function theory. A rational uncertainty measure for belief functions should meet some desirable properties, where monotonicity is a very important property. Recently, measuring the total uncertainty of a belief function based on its associated belief intervals becomes a new research idea and has attracted increasing interest. Several belief interval based uncertainty measures have been proposed for belief functions. In this paper, we summarize the properties of these uncertainty measures and especially investigate whether the monotonicity is satisﬁed by the measures. This study provide a comprehensive comparison to these belief interval based uncertainty measures and is very useful for choosing the appropriate uncertainty measure in the practical applications.","date":"09/2018","language":"en","archive":"Q1","archiveLocation":"工程技术1区 Top","libraryCatalog":"计算机：人工智能2区","callNumber":"8.9924","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21999","accessDate":"2023-01-19T06:22:14Z","rights":"8.9264","extra":"Citation Key: deng2018analyzing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"33","pages":"1869-1879","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/int.21999","issue":"9","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Intell Syst","ISSN":"08848173","creators":[{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T06:22:14Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Y8ES2UW5","itemID":856,"attachments":[{"key":"XDLUCALT","version":6044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"@Deng2018.md","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"","filename":"@Deng2018.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:42:51Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:42:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XDLUCALT","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\XDLUCALT\\@Deng2018.md","defaultPath":"files/1178/@Deng2018.md"},{"key":"ILGB5GW4","version":6044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2018-Analyzing the monotonicity of belief interval based uncertainty measures in.pdf","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2018-Analyzing the monotonicity of belief interval based uncertainty measures in.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T06:22:19Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T06:22:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ILGB5GW4","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\ILGB5GW4\\2018-Analyzing the monotonicity of belief interval based uncertainty measures in.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1179/2018-Analyzing the monotonicity of belief interval based uncertainty measures in.pdf"},{"key":"ZK2AKSQG","version":3124,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Deng2018-zotero.md","parentItem":"Y8ES2UW5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"text/plain","charset":"gbk","path":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\Deng2018-zotero.md","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-19T09:27:12Z","dateModified":"2023-01-19T09:27:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZK2AKSQG","localPath":"D:\\Document\\Working\\02-Reading\\mdnotes\\Deng2018-zotero.md","defaultPath":"files/870/Deng2018-zotero.md"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496377,"version":0},"$loki":1515},{"itemID":59,"item":{"key":"YBV54NYZ","version":5492,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Exponential negation of a probability distribution","abstractNote":"Negation operation is important in intelligent information processing.

The proposed exponential negation is an entropy increase operation, and all the probability distributions will converge to the uniform distribution after multiple negation iterations. The convergence speed of the proposed negation is also faster than the existed negation.

Yet, research has yet to seriously address this popular culture phenomenon rooted largely in social media platforms. It is possible that viewing of online cat media improves mood, but this activity may also foster negative outcomes linked to using the Internet for procrastination. The present survey of Internet users (N=6795) explored the correlates of viewing “Internet cats,” motivations for consuming this media, and its potential effects on users. It also tested a conceptual model predicting enjoyment as a function of the relationships between procrastination, guilt, and happiness. Results reveal significant relationships between viewing and personality types and demonstrate conceptual nuances related to the emotional benefits of watching Internet cats.","date":"2015-11-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Emotion regulation, procrastination, and watching cat videos online","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215004343","accessDate":"2022-11-05T09:28:28Z","extra":"Citation Key: myrick2015emotion","volume":"52","pages":"168-176","publicationTitle":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2015.06.001","journalAbbreviation":"Computers in Human Behavior","ISSN":"0747-5632","creators":[{"firstName":"Jessica Gall","lastName":"Myrick","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cats","type":1},{"tag":"Enjoyment","type":1},{"tag":"Guilty pleasure","type":1},{"tag":"Internet use","type":1},{"tag":"Procrastination","type":1},{"tag":"Social media","type":1}],"collections":["GSXRUD79"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-05T09:28:28Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YEZ2Q39N","itemID":371,"attachments":[{"key":"6JHZCYBT","version":6039,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2015-Emotion regulation, procrastination, and watching cat videos online.pdf","parentItem":"YEZ2Q39N","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2015-Emotion regulation, procrastination, and watching cat videos online.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Various entropy algorithms have been presented, but most of them fail to account for the complexity of time series with high accuracy. In this paper, the concept of Belief Entropy-of-Entropy (BEoE) is introduced, it expands entropy of entropy (EoE) into belief structure, and computes quadratic belief entropy to characterize the complexity of biological systems based on multiple time scales. The influence of inherent complex fluctuation, length bound, correlation of time windows, etc. is considered in the BEoE analysis. Application and discussion demonstrate that BEoE has better accurateness and applicability than many existing entropy algorithms.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921010900","extra":"Citation Key: cui2022belief","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"155","pages":"111736","publicationTitle":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111736","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","ISSN":"0960-0779","creators":[{"firstName":"Huizi","lastName":"Cui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lingge","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bingyi","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Deng entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Belief entropy","type":1},{"tag":"Complexity","type":1},{"tag":"D-S evidence theory","type":1},{"tag":"Time series","type":1},{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-04T03:28:42Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YF6BDZRG","itemID":1345,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496404,"version":0},"$loki":1518},{"itemID":1429,"item":{"key":"YH9T24FE","version":5512,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Ranking based on optimal points and win-loss-draw multi-criteria decision-making with application to supplier evaluation problem","abstractNote":"Supplier evaluation is a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that deals with assessment of suppliers as the potential alternatives against various types of criteria. We consider the context where decision makers (DMs) have complete information about the suppliers and criteria. To address the needs of decision makers, a multi-criteria evaluation method named Ranking based on optimal points (RBOP) is developed in this paper. By imitating and simulating human decision-making behavioural patterns, the developed MCDM method selects the best alternative that is closer to what the DM desires. Furthermore, a novel subjective MCDM weighting methods called win-loss-draw (WLD) method is also developed, which is also based on human behavioural pattern. A real case study of domestic cheese brands is considered to apply the developed methods to select the best cheese supplier for an Iranian hypermarket. Compared to other MCDM methods, outputs of the RBOP method show some differences due to the impact of WLD method, which intensified divergence and optimal points during the decision-making process.","date":"2022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421015670","extra":"Citation Key: zakeri2022ranking","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"191","pages":"116258","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116258","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Shervin","lastName":"Zakeri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prasenjit","lastName":"Chatterjee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Naoufel","lastName":"Cheikhrouhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Konstantas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Human behavioural pattern"},{"tag":"Multi-criteria decision-making"},{"tag":"Optimal and optimum alternatives"},{"tag":"RBOP"},{"tag":"Win-loss-draw"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YH9T24FE","itemID":1429,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496410,"version":0},"$loki":1519},{"itemID":937,"item":{"key":"YJ7ISK6S","version":5503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Requirements for total uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence","date":"12/2008","language":"en","archive":"Q2","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"2.4348","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03081070802082486","accessDate":"2023-03-15T06:44:03Z","rights":"2.0878","extra":"Citation Key: abellan2008requirements","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"37","pages":"733-747","publicationTitle":"International Journal of General Systems","DOI":"10.1080/03081070802082486","issue":"6","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Int J Gen Syst","ISSN":"0308-1079, 1563-5104","creators":[{"firstName":"Joaquín","lastName":"Abellán","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrés","lastName":"Masegosa","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RSYBDGZ3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-15T06:44:03Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YJ7ISK6S","itemID":937,"attachments":[{"key":"CFCCD2IX","version":6047,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2008-Requirements for total uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer theory of.pdf","parentItem":"YJ7ISK6S","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2008-Requirements for total uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer theory of.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-16T10:25:05Z","dateModified":"2023-03-16T10:25:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CFCCD2IX","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\CFCCD2IX\\2008-Requirements for total uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer theory of.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1204/2008-Requirements for total uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer theory of.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496418,"version":0},"$loki":1520},{"itemID":459,"item":{"key":"YLUVQK9S","version":5497,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Linear stability analysis of bubble-induced convection in a horizontal liquid layer","date":"2020-11-2","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.053102","accessDate":"2022-11-17T10:10:42Z","extra":"Citation Key: nakamura2020linear","volume":"102","pages":"053102","publicationTitle":"Physical Review E","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevE.102.053102","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Phys.

Heat transfer is by enhanced liquid convection at the surface around the bubble and by rapid evaporation of a thin layer under the sliding bubble. Both these mechanisms are a function of the vapour flow rate and a correlation of the following form is developed: Nu = M(p) RI$~‘PY’.~. A is a function of the critical pressure alone, F(p) is a function of the reduced pressure alone and Re, is based on the mean vapour mass flux from the surface and the tube diameter. The correlation applies to water, refrigerants and organics boiling on tubes of S-50 mm in diameter. Bearing in mind the wide scatter found in pool boiling experiments the correlation fits well with the available world data and is particularly suitable for use in equipment design calculations.","date":"3/1994","language":"en","shortTitle":"Nucleate pool boiling on horizontal tubes","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0017931094900310","accessDate":"2022-11-17T10:22:35Z","extra":"Citation Key: cornwell1994nucleate","volume":"37","pages":"303-309","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","DOI":"10.1016/0017-9310(94)90031-0","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","ISSN":"00179310","creators":[{"firstName":"K.","lastName":"Cornwell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.D.","lastName":"Houston","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-17T10:22:35Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YMDE5IR4","itemID":474,"attachments":[{"key":"QRT3QU7H","version":6045,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1994-Nucleate pool boiling on horizontal tubes.pdf","parentItem":"YMDE5IR4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1994-Nucleate pool boiling on horizontal tubes.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-23T02:16:51Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T02:16:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/QRT3QU7H","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\QRT3QU7H\\1994-Nucleate pool boiling on horizontal tubes.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1187/1994-Nucleate pool boiling on horizontal tubes.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496540,"version":0},"$loki":1522},{"itemID":385,"item":{"key":"YPR3RWC3","version":5496,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effect of particle rolling resistance on drained and undrained behaviour of silty sand","date":"2021","libraryCatalog":"Google Scholar","extra":"Publisher: Springer\nCitation Key: Phan2021","volume":"16","pages":"2657–2682","publicationTitle":"Acta Geotechnica","issue":"8","creators":[{"firstName":"Quoc T.","lastName":"Phan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ha H.","lastName":"Bui","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giang D.","lastName":"Nguyen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdelmalek","lastName":"Bouazza","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RLN987UH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-14T09:00:14Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YPR3RWC3","itemID":385,"attachments":[{"key":"KFX8H7FI","version":6032,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11440-020-01128-y","accessDate":"2022-11-14T09:00:44Z","parentItem":"YPR3RWC3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"s11440-020-01128-y.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-14T09:00:44Z","dateModified":"2022-11-14T09:00:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/KFX8H7FI","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\KFX8H7FI\\s11440-020-01128-y.html","defaultPath":"files/388/s11440-020-01128-y.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496547,"version":0},"$loki":1523},{"itemID":698,"item":{"key":"YVAKSJJB","version":5501,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evaporation-driven dewetting of a liquid film","date":"2016-8-16","language":"en","archive":"Q2","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"2.8949","url":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.041901","accessDate":"2022-12-16T15:04:19Z","extra":"Citation Key: fourgeaud2016evaporationdriven","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"1","pages":"041901","publicationTitle":"Physical Review Fluids","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.041901","issue":"4","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Phys.

Firstly, a conditional constraint model i+ ≻ i−∣X is proposed, which means that users prefer i+ to i− under the constraint of X. Based on this model, we design a MPM algorithm to efficiently obtain users contextual preferences by using graphic model and new pruning strategies. Then, we propose an updated belief system and the concept of common belief. The belief system is constructed by using users common preferences, and combined with Bayesian approach to acquire users’ Top-K preference rules. Finally, the experiment result indicates that MPM algorithm is far more efficient than three classic or leading-edge mining algorithms in mining all rules and has comparable performance with 2 state-of-the-art Top-K methods. Moreover, the experiment results on Recall, precision and F1-Measure show that MPM algorithm comprehensively outperforms than six kinds various algorithms.","date":"2020","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419307602","extra":"Citation Key: tan2020topk","volume":"143","pages":"113043","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113043","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Tan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Association rules"},{"tag":"Belief system"},{"tag":"Conditional preference rules"},{"tag":"Interestingness measure"},{"tag":"Maxclique"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:48Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:51:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/YZ678R29","itemID":1472,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496568,"version":0},"$loki":1526},{"itemID":1518,"item":{"key":"Z3433UR7","version":5677,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"浅谈我国企业营销道德的缺失","abstractNote":"道德,是人们在社会生活实践中关于善恶与是非的观念、情感和行为习惯,是依靠社会舆论和良心指导的人格完善与调节人与人、人与自然关系的规范系统。利益是道德的基础,利益的冲突产生了道德问题。企业的营销活动不可避免的会影响企业的利益相关者的利益。因此也就出现了营销道德问题。我国实行改革开放以来,推行社会主义市场经济体制,在传统社会向现代市场经济社会转型中的中国,传统道德的断层及商品经济带来的享乐主义的冲击。使营销人员的营销观念产生了偏差,产生了假冒伪劣、贿赂、欺骗、虚假广告等不道德营销行为,不仅侵害了消费者和社会大众的利益,而且对企业长远的发展非常不利。随着市场经济的发展和世界经济的加速融合,我国企业营销道德的问题愈显迫切。本文旨在从内部和外部两个方面,来分析我国企业营销道德缺失的原因,从而为尽快解决这一问题做出理论上的努力。","date":"2013","language":"zh-CN","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=0&CurRec=23&recid=&FileName=QYDB201301094&DbName=CJFD2013&DbCode=CJFD&yx=&pr=CJFY2013;&URLID=","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:22:55Z","extra":"Citation Key: zhang2013qian","seriesTitle":"无","pages":"127-128+30","publicationTitle":"企业导报","DOI":"10.19354/j.cnki.42-1616/f.2013.01.094","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"企业导报","ISSN":"1671-1599","creators":[{"name":"张莉","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"耿改智","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"营销道德","type":1},{"tag":"道德","type":1},{"tag":"营销道德缺失","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:22:55Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T04:14:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Z3433UR7","itemID":1518,"attachments":[{"key":"CKUCZ5NJ","version":6053,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2013-浅谈我国企业营销道德的缺失.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJPYxPoFw%2bp%2bi0fIiSrcN6lXK2O6qHfXH%2bO8qWCY%2fOqTUzE%2bT0XwXrqwGh69eQOrhrTeVu5Rs5wkJzzPB%2bz1dhj8tqddCdidyosdSaMNWur3ZJBjdlDrNnftoR5pdZPiFRNlKM4sfpT3nRHSqBOA4sms8GQBtE8Z8mK%2fNwS15YoSEWXJ%2bg5fW8m%2fKY8s%2fAoxmfaopkQ6JnjQzfIvFcCnka0M%3d","accessDate":"2023-04-29T13:23:06Z","parentItem":"Z3433UR7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2013-浅谈我国企业营销道德的缺失.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-29T13:23:06Z","dateModified":"2023-04-29T13:23:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/CKUCZ5NJ","localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\CKUCZ5NJ\\2013-浅谈我国企业营销道德的缺失.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1526/2013-浅谈我国企业营销道德的缺失.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496575,"version":0},"$loki":1527},{"itemID":711,"item":{"key":"Z3WGL2YP","version":6033,"itemType":"attachment","title":"重力热管弹状流工况的简化分析.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"重力热管弹状流工况的简化分析.pdf","tags":[{"tag":"read"},{"tag":"theromophton"}],"collections":["WSFAML84"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-17T04:32:15Z","dateModified":"2022-12-17T13:02:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/Z3WGL2YP","itemID":711,"localPath":"C:\\Users\\admin\\OneDrive\\应用\\remotely-save\\content\\private\\08-Assets\\pdfs\\zotero data\\storage\\Z3WGL2YP\\重力热管弹状流工况的简化分析.pdf","defaultPath":"files/711/重力热管弹状流工况的简化分析.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496579,"version":0},"$loki":1528},{"itemID":1465,"item":{"key":"ZECJVT7Y","version":5515,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The similarities and divergences between grey and fuzzy theory","abstractNote":"This article aims to provide the reader with a clearer understanding of the similarities and the divergences that exist between grey and fuzzy theory. The notion of fuzzy is considerably more established to that of grey, however, in recent years grey theory has garnered traction and has become more noticeable to wider audiences. Both can be seen as being proponents of uncertainty modelling, within their repertoires there are indeed facets that are similar in nature, and it is precisely these considerations that will often cause confusion. As grey theory generates more popularity, there will evidently be a need to address the issues regarding the similarities. The differences that exist in some cases are intrinsically subtle, hence the need for a definitive explanation. They are two distinctly separate paradigms, however, one could be forgiven for assuming that grey theory utilises fuzzy notions, simply presented with a different name. This article will aim to provide the reader with a coherent pairwise comparison of instances where similarities occur, describing the perspective adopted from both approaches. What will be covered will include the differences that exist between an interval-valued fuzzy set to that of a grey set; interval and grey numbers — both the discrete and the generalised grey number. Also highlighted will be the links to that of probability theory; imprecise and precise; belief and possibility functions. In describing the differences one will also gain an understanding of the similarities that indeed exist between the two.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421011805","extra":"Citation Key:

benchmark of machine learning approaches for credit score prediction","abstractNote":"Credit risk assessment plays a key role for correctly supporting financial institutes in defining their bank policies and commercial strategies. Over the last decade, the emerging of social lending platforms has disrupted traditional services for credit risk assessment. Through these platforms, lenders and borrowers can easily interact among them without any involvement of financial institutes. In particular, they support borrowers in the fundraising process, enabling the participation of any number and size of lenders. However, the lack of lenders’ experience and missing or uncertain information about borrower’s credit history can increase risks in social lending platforms, requiring an accurate credit risk scoring. To overcome such issues, the credit risk assessment problem of financial operations is usually modeled as a binary problem on the basis of debt’s repayment and proper machine learning techniques can be consequently exploited. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking study of some of the most used credit risk scoring models to predict if a loan will be repaid in a P2P platform. We deal with a class imbalance problem and leverage several classifiers among the most used in the literature, which are based on different sampling techniques. A real social lending platform (Lending Club) data-set, composed by 877,956 samples, has been used to perform the experimental analysis considering different evaluation metrics (i.e. AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity), also comparing the obtained outcomes with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the three best approaches have also been evaluated in terms of their explainability by means of different eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420307636","extra":"Citation Key: moscato2021benchmark","volume":"165","pages":"113986","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113986","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Moscato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Picariello","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Sperlí","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Supervised learning"},{"tag":"Machine learning"},{"tag":"Benchmark"},{"tag":"Credit score prediction"},{"tag":"Explainable artificial intelligence"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:45Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZHHG3XIR","itemID":1436,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496599,"version":0},"$loki":1532},{"itemID":1238,"item":{"key":"ZSTCIXG6","version":5506,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Enhancing PROMETHEE method with intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets","date":"2020","callNumber":"8.9924","rights":"8.9264","extra":"Publisher: Wiley Online Library\nCitation Key: feng2020enhancing","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"35","pages":"1071–1104","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","issue":"7","seriesText":"无","creators":[{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Feng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zeshui","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hamido","lastName":"Fujita","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Meiqi","lastName":"Liang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"sn-article","type":1}],"collections":["444KMZK3"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-03-25T04:02:56Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T04:10:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZSTCIXG6","itemID":1238,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496603,"version":0},"$loki":1533},{"itemID":691,"item":{"key":"ZUWJHTAC","version":5501,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Dynamic Film Model of the Pulsating Heat Pipe","abstractNote":"This article deals with the numerical modeling of the pulsating heat pipe (PHP) and is based on the film evaporation/condensation model recently applied to the single-bubble PHP (Das et al., 2010, “Thermally Induced Two-Phase Oscillating Flow Inside a Capillary Tube,” Int.

In complex multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), how to rank TFNs and get the best alternative from MAGDM are two important issues. Existing ranking methods of TFNs only consider the minimum value, the maximum value and the most likely value, which ignores the other possible values. To avoid the limitation, the preference degree of TFNs is defined combining the probability with possibility of TFN, which considers all the possible values in TFN. Then a preference degree based algorithm is designed to rank TFNs. Furthermore, the triangular fuzzy MAGDM is investigated. Considering the group consensus of DMs, the attitude-based individual consensus index of DM is defined and applied to determine DMs’ weights. The attribute weights are obtained by the comprehensive utility ratings of alternatives with a control parameter. Thus, a new method is proposed to solve triangular fuzzy MAGDM problem. Finally, a public experience evaluation in new smart city is applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAGDM method.","date":"2021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421004231","extra":"Citation Key: wang2021preference","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"178","pages":"114982","publicationTitle":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114982","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"Expert Systems with Applications","ISSN":"0957-4174","creators":[{"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Attitude-based consensus index"},{"tag":"Multi-attribute group decision making"},{"tag":"Preference degree"},{"tag":"Triangular fuzzy number"}],"collections":["WU8SRD42"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-25T00:53:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-27T03:55:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/ZWNK4MKI","itemID":1420,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1683117496617,"version":0},"$loki":1535},{"itemID":1613,"item":{"key":"XQN7VMW4","version":5733,"itemType":"thesis","title":"移动互联网中基于位置服务的隐私保护方案研究","abstractNote":"随着手持设备智能化的不断完善、移动通信技术的快速发展以及定位技术的不断成熟,人们可以自由地接入移动互联网并享受基于位置服务带来的便利。基于位置服务的应用在生活服务、社交和休闲娱乐等领域发挥了巨大的作用,并已经成为人们日常生活中不可或缺的一部分。然而,基于位置服务的请求中包含了大量的用户敏感信息,如果不注重对用户敏感信息的保护,潜在的攻击者（如基于位置的服务提供者）可以轻易地通过对用户敏感信息的收集获取用户的隐私信息。因此,如何保护移动用户的隐私已成为基于位置服务健康发展的严峻挑战,对基于位置服务的隐私保护研究已成当务之急。本文以保证用户隐私安全的同时提供高质量服务为研究核心和目标,并以基于位置服务的不同应用领域为分类基础,分别研究了基于兴趣点模式、基于社交模式和基于评论模式等三种模式中的隐私保护与效用问题。本文的主要研究内容如下:（1）在基于兴趣点模式的非外包云场景中,本文针对移动用户自组网体系结构中的隐私保护和效用问题,提出了一个基于POI分类表的隐私保护方案。具体内容如下:针对用户组网时偏好隐私的脆弱性,通过设计POI分类表的方式保护自组网过程中用户的偏好隐私。基于自组网中用户是不完全可信的前提,该方案采用加法同态的方式完成组内POI种类的计算,这种方式可以使自组网中的锚点用户在不知道组内用户POI查询类型的情况下计算出组内的POI种类,因而能够有效对自组网过程中用户的偏好隐私进行保护。通过研究自组网过程中用户位置数量k和用户POI查询种类l与其相应隐私保护阈值（thk,th1）之间的动态关系,设计自适应模式的算法提升自组网的组网效率和成功率。理论分析和实验表明,该方案能够有效保护自组网过程中用户的偏好隐私,并提高自组网的组网效率和成功率;（2）在基于兴趣点模式的外包云场景中,本文针对空间范围查询中的隐私保护和效用问题,提出了一个基于双云架构的隐私保护方案。具体内容如下:针对单个云架构面临的数据存储和计算风险,通过分而治之的思想将外包云设计为双云架构并将敏感信息分别存储在两个非共谋云上,这种结构在保障外包数据机密性的同时具有一定抵御内部攻击的能力。基于传输信道上有窃听者的情况,通过双云处理用户查询的方式,使该方案在保障用户查询安全的同时提高了抵抗窃听攻击的能力。通过使用同态加密和可搜索对称加密技术,该方案同时支持范围查询和类型查询,在保证用户查询安全的基础上,有效地提高了查询的针对性,减少了云端和用户端的计算负担。理论分析和实验表明,该方案能够在外包云场景中保护用户隐私,并且提高外包云的数据检索效率;（3）在基于社交模式中,本文针对朋友位置查询中的隐私保护和效用问题,提出了一个位置检索高效的隐私保护方案。具体内容如下:针对用户自定义的隐私保护需求,该方案提出了一种新的用户自定义访问控制策略——网格单元访问控制策略。对于用户不愿意与朋友分享的地理位置或敏感区域,用户可以使用该访问控制策略来防止隐私在社交网络中泄露。为提高朋友位置查询时的位置检索效率,该方案基于网格结构和用户的查询距离,设计了一个名为关联网格的方法。通过该方法,该方案可以在保护用户隐私的基础上,过滤出不在关联网格中的朋友位置,减少位置服务器进行距离计算和比较的负担,相比之前方案提升了位置检索效率。成本和安全分析表明了该方案是一种实用和有效的隐私保护方案,仿真实验也验证了该方案的有效性;（4）在基于评论模式中,本文针对由用户发布评论引起的隐私保护和效用问题,提出了一个增强评论指引有效性的隐私保护方案。具体内容如下:针对由用户评论分布和数量特征引起的身份识别或推理攻击,该方案通过形式化攻击者模型和定义用户相似性概率的方式,评估发表评论用户被识别的可能性。在此基础上,结合用户的隐私保护阈值决定用户公开评论的发布数量,从而在不影响用户发表评论积极性的情况下降低用户遭受身份识别或推理攻击的风险。为了提高评论的指引有效性作用,减少虚假评论的影响,该方案采用投票决策规则和Beta信誉机制为用户建立信誉系统,并以用户的信誉值作为评论列表中评论排名的依据,达到提高评论指引有效性的目的。理论分析和仿真实验表明,该方案能够有效抵御身份识别或推理攻击,并提升评论的指引有效性作用。","date":"2021","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CNKI","url":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?sfield=fn&QueryID=1&CurRec=5&FileName=1021086035.nh&DbName=CDFDLAST2022&DbCode=CDFD","accessDate":"2023-04-30T12:27:26Z","extra":"DOI: 10.26969/d.cnki.gbydu.2021.000165\nCitation Key: yangguangcan2021yi","thesisType":"博士","university":"北京邮电大学","creators":[{"name":"杨光灿","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"移动互联网","type":1},{"tag":"高质量服务","type":1},{"tag":"基于位置服务","type":1},{"tag":"隐私保护","type":1},{"tag":"high-quality service","type":1},{"tag":"location-based service","type":1},{"tag":"mobile internet","type":1},{"tag":"privacy protection","type":1}],"collections":["SY7S9C99"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-04-30T12:27:26Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T12:27:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/XQN7VMW4","itemID":1613,"attachments":[{"key":"3C2YDASB","version":6051,"itemType":"attachment","title":"2021-移动互联网中基于位置服务的隐私保护方案研究.pdf","url":"https://bar.cnki.net/bar/download/order?id=jBGETXBNdPImvx70aLAuJKPd5%2bH15oC8gGzxs3xdBxitj0TGe9wdEhvGe324CMvIEBmWIvuz0Y15xF283Q1NvAuKwE6bAq9gYW%2fVQo64jGr63KDnJ7T691%2b%2fxqKkU%2fIuyIYzWVm92m0yuYKGut639uLkNvX1T1oyTzo0iPXtbtkyI%2bMzzRbqad9DSrV8HgXoHN0d%2bY5uPZdLNJQl5%2fV7lmVIXnBqnEq8wB48LItgXQLY9Rh0t1%2fsHPJmvPacC%2fDw","accessDate":"2023-04-30T12:27:34Z","parentItem":"XQN7VMW4","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2021-移动互联网中基于位置服务的隐私保护方案研究.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Here comes the question: what would happen if the combinatorial number is replaced by permutation number? To address this issue, a new kind of set, named as random permutation set (RPS), is proposed in this paper, which consists of permutation event space (PES) and permutation mass function (PMF). The PES of a certain set considers all the permutation of that set. The elements of PES are called the permutation events. PMF describes the chance of a certain permutation event that would happen. Based on PES and PMF, RPS can be viewed as a permutation-based generalization of random ﬁnite set. Besides, the right intersection (RI) and left intersection (LI) of permutation events are presented. Based on RI and LI, the right orthogonal sum (ROS) and left orthogonal sum (LOS) of PMFs are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the proposed conceptions. The comparisons of probability theory, evidence theory, and RPS are discussed and summarized. Moreover, an RPS-based data fusion algorithm is proposed and applied in threat assessment. The experimental results show that the proposed RPS-based algorithm can reasonably and efﬁciently deal with uncertainty in threat assessment with respect to threat ranking and reliability ranking.","date":"2022-01-10","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/4542","accessDate":"2023-03-15T05:30:53Z","extra":"Citation Key: deng2022random","seriesTitle":"无","volume":"17","publicationTitle":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL","DOI":"10.15837/ijccc.2022.1.4542","issue":"1","seriesText":"无","journalAbbreviation":"INT J COMPUT COMMUN, Int.

However, such machine learning models fail to identify the classes, which were not available during training time. These classes can be referred to as\n              unseen classes\n              . Open-world Machine Learning (OWML) is a novel technique, which deals with unseen classes. Although OWML is around for a few years and many significant research works have been carried out in this domain, there is no comprehensive survey of the characteristics, applications, and impact of OWML on the major research areas. In this article, we aimed to capture the different dimensions of OWML with respect to other traditional machine learning models. We have thoroughly analyzed the existing literature and provided a novel taxonomy of OWML considering its two major application domains: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. We listed the available software packages and open datasets in OWML for future researchers. Finally, the article concludes with a set of research gaps, open challenges, and future directions.","date":"2023-10-31","language":"en","shortTitle":"Open-world Machine
