The DST is based on the concept of a basic probability assignment. An important part of this theory is the quantification of the information-based-uncertainty that this function represents. A recent measure of uncertainty (or information) in this theory, called the Deng entropy, has appeared as an interesting alternative to the measures presented so far. This measure quantifies the both types of uncertainty found in DST, then it is considered as a total uncertainty measure (TU). It is shown that this measure does not verify some of the essential properties for a TU in DST such as monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity. Also, the definition of this new measure produces other debatable situations.

Recently there has been great success in single image dehazing, i.e., improving the visibility and restoring the colors from a single image. A crucial step in these methods is the calculation of the air-light color, the color of an area of the image with no objects in line-of-sight. We propose a new method for calculating the air-light. The method relies on the haze-lines prior that was recently introduced. This prior is based on the observation that the pixel values of a hazy image can be modeled as lines in RGB space that intersect at the air-light. We use Hough transform in RGB space to vote for the location of the air-light. We evaluate the proposed method on an existing dataset of real world images, as well as some synthetic and other real images.

Attenuation under water varies with wavelength, unlike terrestrial images where attenuation is assumed to be spectrally uniform. The attenuation depends both on the water body and the 3D structure of the scene, making color restoration difficult. Unlike existing single underwater image enhancement techniques, our method takes into account multiple spectral profiles of different water types. By estimating just two additional global parameters: the attenuation ratios of the blue-red and blue-green color channels, the problem is reduced to single image dehazing, where all color channels have the same attenuation coefficients. Since the water type is unknown, we evaluate different parameters out of an existing library of water types. Each type leads to a different restored image and the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution. We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying water properties, showing color charts in the scenes. Moreover, to obtain ground truth, the 3D structure of the scene was calculated based on stereo imaging. This dataset enables a quantitative evaluation of restoration algorithms on natural images and shows the advantage of our method.},\n  archiveprefix = {arxiv},\n  keywords = {color restoration,Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,spectral profiles,underwater images,开源,色衰},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\92SRKJVK\\\\2019-Underwater Single Image Color Restoration Using Haze-Lines and a New.pdf;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\Q6RWUP9D\\\\1811.html}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110898,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2057},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":960,"entry":"@article{beynon2006Role,\n  title = {The {{Role}} of the {{DS}}/{{AHP}} in {{Identifying Inter-Group Alliances}} and {{Majority Rule Within Group Decision Making}}},\n  author = {Beynon, Malcolm J.},\n  year = {2006},\n  month = jan,\n  journal = {Group Decision and Negotiation},\n  volume = {15},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {21--42},\n  issn = {0926-2644, 1572-9907},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10726-005-1159-9},\n  urldate = {2023-03-15},\n  abstract = {DS/AHP is a nascent method of multi-criteria decision-making, based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and indirectly the Analytic Hierarchy Process. It is concerned with the identification of the levels of preference that decision makers have towards certain decision alternatives (DAs), through preference judgements made over a number of different criteria. The working result from a DS/AHP analysis is the body of evidence (BOE), which includes a series of mass values that represent the exact beliefs in the best DA(s) existing within certain subsets of DAs. This paper considers the role of DS/AHP as an aid to group decision-making, through the utilisation of a distance measure (between BOEs). Here, the distance measure enables the identification of the members of the decision-making group who are in most agreement, with respect to the judgements they have individually made. The utilisation of a single linkage dendrite approach to clustering elucidates an appropriate order to the aggregation of the judgements of the group members.

In this paper, we provide a discussion on confidence as it relates to the evaluation of IFS, and compare it with the existing concepts in the URREF ontology. Our goal is two-fold, since we address both the distinctions between confidence and self-confidence, as well as the implications of these differences when evaluating the impact of uncertainty to the decision-making processes supported byt the IFS. We illustrate the discussion with an example of decision making that involves signal detection theory, confusion matrix fusion, subjective logic, and proportional conflict redistribution.

Starting from a dehazing model backbone that is pre-trained on synthetic data, PSD exploits real hazy images to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion. For the fine-tuning, we leverage several well-grounded physical priors and combine them into a prior loss committee. PSD allows for most of the existing dehazing models as its backbone, and the combination of multiple physical priors boosts dehazing significantly. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PSD framework establishes the new stateof-the-art performance for real-world dehazing, in terms of visual quality assessed by no-reference quality metrics as well as subjective evaluation and downstream task performance indicator.},\n  isbn = {978-1-66544-509-2},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\SDBFI24B\\\\2021-PSD.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110928,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2068},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":132,"entry":"@article{Chen2022entropy,\n  title = {Entropy of {{Random Permutation Set}}},\n  author = {Chen, Luyuan and Deng, Yong},\n  pages = {24},\n  abstract = {Recently, a new kind of set, named as Random Permutation Set (RPS), is proposed.

When each permutation event is limited to containing just one element, the proposed RPS entropy degenerates into Shannon entropy in probability theory.

Owing to its advantages, evidence theory has more flexibility and effectiveness for modeling and processing uncertain information. Uncertainty measure plays an essential role both in evidence theory and probability theory. In probability theory, Shannon entropy provides a novel perspective for measuring uncertainty. Various entropies exist for measuring the uncertainty of basic probability assignment (BPA) in evidence theory. However, from the standpoint of the requirements of uncertainty measurement and physics, these entropies are controversial. Therefore, the process for measuring BPA uncertainty currently remains an open issue in the literature. Firstly, this paper reviews the measures of uncertainty in evidence theory followed by an analysis of some related controversies. Secondly, we discuss the development of Deng entropy as an effective way to measure uncertainty, including introducing its definition, analyzing its properties, and comparing it to other measures. We also examine the concept of maximum Deng entropy, the pseudo-Pascal triangle of maximum Deng entropy, generalized belief entropy, and measures of divergence. In addition, we conduct an analysis of the application of Deng entropy and further examine the challenges for future studies on uncertainty measurement in evidence theory. Finally, a conclusion is provided to summarize this study.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\7KCNAX75\\\\2020-Uncertainty measure in evidence theory2.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110962,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2082},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1226,"entry":"@article{deng2021information,\n  title = {Information Volume of Fuzzy Membership Function},\n  author = {Deng, Jixiang and Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2021},\n  journal = {International Journal of Computers Communications \\& Control},\n  volume = {16},\n  number = {1},\n  copyright = {1.9261},\n  lccn = {2.6349}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110963,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2083},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":124,"entry":"@article{Deng2022maximum,\n  title = {Maximum Entropy of Random Permutation Set},\n  author = {Deng, Jixiang and Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = nov,\n  journal = {Soft Computing},\n  volume = {26},\n  number = {21},\n  pages = {11265--11275},\n  issn = {1432-7643, 1433-7479},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00500-022-07351-x},\n  urldate = {2022-10-06},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Users\\\\Jeffey\\\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\\\Obsidian Sync\\\\Working\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\2022-Maximum entropy of random permutation set.pdf;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\HD3T2D3V\\\\@Deng.md}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110964,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2084},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":934,"entry":"@article{Deng2022random,\n  title = {Random {{Permutation Set}}},\n  author = {Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = jan,\n  journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS  COMMUNICATIONS \\& CONTROL},\n  volume = {17},\n  number = {1},\n  issn = {1841-9844, 1841-9836},\n  doi = {10.15837/ijccc.2022.1.4542},\n  urldate = {2023-03-15},\n  abstract = {For exploring the meaning of the power set in evidence theory, a possible explanation of power set is proposed from the view of Pascal's triangle and combinatorial number. Here comes the question: what would happen if the combinatorial number is replaced by permutation number? To address this issue, a new kind of set, named as random permutation set (RPS), is proposed in this paper, which consists of permutation event space (PES) and permutation mass function (PMF). The PES of a certain set considers all the permutation of that set. The elements of PES are called the permutation events. PMF describes the chance of a certain permutation event that would happen. Based on PES and PMF, RPS can be viewed as a permutation-based generalization of random finite set. Besides, the right intersection (RI) and left intersection (LI) of permutation events are presented. Based on RI and LI, the right orthogonal sum (ROS) and left orthogonal sum (LOS) of PMFs are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the proposed conceptions. The comparisons of probability theory, evidence theory, and RPS are discussed and summarized. Moreover, an RPS-based data fusion algorithm is proposed and applied in threat assessment.

Recent advances suggest to interpret the mass function from a view of quantum theory. However, existing studies do not truly implement the quantization of evidence. In order to solve the problem, a usable quantization scheme for mass function is studied in this paper. At first, a novel quantum model of mass function is proposed, which effectively embodies the principle of quantum superposition. Then, a quantum averaging operator is designed to obtain the quantum average of evidence, which not only retains many basic properties, for example idempotency, commutativity, and quasi-associativity, required by a rational approach for uncertain information fusion, but also yields some new characters, namely nonlinearity and globality, caused by the quantization of mass functions. At last, based on the quantum averaging operator, a new rule called quantum average combination rule is developed for the fusion of multiple pieces of evidence, which is compared with other representative average-based combination methods to show its performance. Numerical examples and applications for classification tasks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantum model, averaging operator, and combination rule.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\ZDFPJRNI\\\\2023-A novel quantum model of mass function for uncertain information fusion.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608110970,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2087},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":327,"entry":"@inproceedings{deVilliers2015,\n  title = {Uncertainty Representation, Quantification and Evaluation for Data and Information Fusion},\n  booktitle = {2015 18th {{International Conference}} on {{Information Fusion}} ({{Fusion}})},\n  author = {{de Villiers}, J.

These are often owing to incorrect or invalid simplifying assumptions during the modelling process. The authors investigate the sources of uncertainty in the modelling process. In particular, four processes of abstraction are identified where uncertainty may enter the modelling process. These are isolation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced by isolating a portion of the real world to be modelled), datum uncertainty (where uncertainty is introduced by representing real world information by a mathematical quantity), data generation abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of the mapping between a real-world process and an observable datum), and process abstraction (where uncertainty is introduced through a mathematical representation of real world entities and processes).

The degraded image has some problems, such as color distortion, low-visibility, fuzz and non-uniform luminance, due to the light is absorbed and scattered by particles in sandstorm. The proposed approach based on fusion principles aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations. First, the degraded image is color corrected by adopting a statistical strategy. Then two inputs, which represent different brightness, are derived only from the color corrected image by applying Gamma correction. Three weighted maps (sharpness, chromaticity and prominence), which contain important features to increase the quality of the degraded image, are computed from the derived inputs. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by fusing the inputs with the weight maps. The proposed method is the first to adopt a fusion-based method for enhancing single sandstorm image. Experimental results show that enhanced results can be improved by color correction, well enhanced details and local contrast while promoted global brightness, increasing the visibility, naturalness preservation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is mostly calculated by per-pixel operation, which is appropriate for real-time applications.},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-5896-2},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {fusion-based method,image enhancement,sandstorm},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\R37B6E38\\\\Fu 等 - 2014 - A fusion-based enhancing approach for single sands.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111022,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2104},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1237,"entry":"@article{fujita2019hypotheses,\n  title = {Hypotheses Analysis and Assessment in Counterterrorism Activities: A Method Based on {{OWA}} and Fuzzy Probabilistic Rough Sets},\n  author = {Fujita, Hamido and Gaeta, Angelo and Loia, Vincenzo and Orciuoli, Francesco},\n  year = {2019},\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems},\n  volume = {28},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {831--845},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  copyright = {11.6369},\n  lccn = {12.2529}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111023,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2105},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":787,"entry":"@article{funada2005Ellipsoidal,\n  title = {Ellipsoidal Model of the Rise of a {{Taylor}} Bubble in a Round Tube},\n  author = {Funada, T. and Joseph, D.D. and Maehara, T. and Yamashita, S.},\n  year = {2005},\n  month = apr,\n  journal = {International Journal of Multiphase Flow},\n  volume = {31},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {473--491},\n  issn = {03019322},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2004.11.010},\n  urldate = {2022-12-18},\n  abstract = {The rise velocity of long gas bubbles (Taylor bubbles) in round tubes is modeled by an ovary ellipsoidal cap bubble rising in an irrotational flow of a viscous liquid.

But the relationship of the other entropy functions with Pascal triangle is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory takes the advantage to deal with uncertainty than probability theory since the probability distribution is generalized as basic probability assignment, which is more efficient to model and handle uncertain information. Given a basic probability assignment, its corresponding uncertainty measure can be determined by Deng entropy, which is the generalization of Shannon entropy.

Inspired by this view, the paper propose the new method to measure conflict between bodies of evidence. Firstly, we define a new information volume of mass function for the perspective of information discord and non-specificity. Second, we propose a generalized divergence based on information volume of mass function, denoted as Jensen\\textendash Shannon divergence of information volume ({$\\mathsl{I}\\mathsl{J}$} {$\\mathsl{S}$}). {$\\mathsl{I}\\mathsl{J}$} {$\\mathsl{S}$} can effectively measure the conflict between bodies of evidence. {$\\mathsl{I}\\mathsl{J}$} {$\\mathsl{S}$} reflects the conflict between bodies of evidence in terms of the differences between the support of propositions and the elements.

We suggest that the RO property should be utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks, extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information. Experimental results on four tasks, i.e., noise-free image super-resolution (SR), realistic image SR, gray-scale image denoising, and color image denoising, show that the method is effective and efficient for image restoration, and it delivers superior performance for realistic image SR and color image denoising.},\n  archiveprefix = {arxiv},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Image and Video Processing},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\S2EA7KWR\\\\2022-Rank-One Network.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111039,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2110},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1316,"entry":"@article{gautam2020Improved,\n  title = {An {{Improved Air-Light Estimation Scheme}} for {{Single Haze Images Using Color Constancy Prior}}},\n  author = {Gautam, Sidharth and Gandhi, Tapan Kumar and Panigrahi, B.K.},\n  year = {2020},\n  journal = {IEEE Signal Processing Letters},\n  volume = {27},\n  pages = {1695--1699},\n  issn = {1070-9908, 1558-2361},\n  doi = {10.1109/LSP.2020.3025462},\n  urldate = {2023-03-29},\n  abstract = {Hazy environment attenuates the scene radiance and causes difficulty in distinguishing the color and texture of the scene.

The fundamental understanding of the working of the part-unit cell is imperative in the development of a complete Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a PHP. The compressible model developed in the present work is based on the Volume-of-Fluid solver of the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM, in which the contour-based interface reconstruction algorithm and the contact-line evaporation model have been incorporated. Owing to the lack of a single standard benchmark validation case for a compressible phase-change solver, a huge emphasis in the present work is laid on the solver development and validation, the latter part of which is conducted in stages. Furthermore, simulations for the formation of a Taylor-Bubble through a constrained bubble growth are performed and the fallacy of an incompressible solver is shown distinctly. The validated solver is used to model a part-unit cell of a PHP and a parametric study is performed on the part-unit cell. The effect of variation of evaporator length, evaporator superheat, and liquid fill ratio on the performance of the PHP is discussed.},\n  copyright = {2.330},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {2.5691},\n  keywords = {Taylor bubbles},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\ACZ9EAWQ\\\\2016-Modeling of compressible phase-change heat transfer in a Taylor-Bubble with.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111054,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2113},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":688,"entry":"@article{gully2014EVALUATION,\n  title = {{{EVALUATION OF THE VAPOR THERMODYNAMIC STATE IN PHP}}},\n  author = {Gully, P. and Bonnet, F. and Nikolayev, Vadim S. and Luchier, N. and Tran, T.

The heat is transferred due to self-sustained oscillations of vapor bubbles and liquid plugs in a unique capillary tube which links the hot and cold sources in several turns or branches. Increasingly strong efforts are devoted to PHP simulation models which need to be experimentally assessed. Recent models show the importance of the thermodynamic state of the vapor bulk. Indeed it may deviate from the saturation conditions due to vapor transient compression/expansion. This study aims at measuring and calculating the vapor state in a horizontal single branch PHP which allows generating oscillations of a liquid meniscus in a capillary tube with one open end, at which the pressure is imposed. The experimental setup uses oxygen at cryogenic temperatures which reduces as much as possible the radiation losses of both sensors (microscopic thermocouple) used for the direct vapor temperature measurement and of the whole PHP. We present here the simultaneous experimental measurements of the vapor pressure and temperature. The data are compared to the theoretical modeling obtained within the film evaporation/condensation model of PHP [Das et al., 2010]. The model is extended to account for the thermal gradient along and across the tube walls formed because of the poor heat conductivity of its material. The vapor is found superheated, which demonstrates the relevance of the model. The vapor temperature oscillates around the evaporator temperature. The heat transfer between the vapor and the dry evaporator wall explains this result. The corresponding heat transfer coefficient is calculated using DNS. The comparison shows an agreement between the experiment and the model.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Capillary tube,one branch php},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\QFCLZXV7\\\\2014-EVALUATION OF THE VAPOR THERMODYNAMIC STATE IN PHP.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111056,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2114},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":25,"entry":"@article{Haenni2002,\n  title = {Are Alternatives to {{Dempster}}'s Rule of Combination Real Alternatives?},\n  author = {Haenni, Rolf},\n  year = {2002},\n  month = sep,\n  journal = {Information Fusion},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {237--239},\n  issn = {15662535},\n  doi = {10.1016/S1566-2535(02)00076-3},\n  urldate = {2022-09-18},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Users\\\\Jeffey\\\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\\\Obsidian Sync\\\\Working\\\\02-Reading\\\\mdnotes\\\\@Haenni2002.md;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\APXVVKCQ\\\\2002-Are alternatives to Dempster's rule of combination real alternatives.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111057,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2115},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":920,"entry":"@article{han2016Evaluation,\n  title = {Evaluation of {{Probability Transformations}} of {{Belief Functions}} for {{Decision Making}}},\n  author = {Han, Deqiang and Dezert, Jean and Duan, Zhansheng},\n  year = {2016},\n  month = jan,\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},\n  volume = {46},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {93--108},\n  issn = {2168-2216, 2168-2232},\n  doi = {10.1109/TSMC.2015.2421883},\n  urldate = {2023-03-05},\n  abstract = {The transformation of belief function into probability is one of the most important and common ways for decision making under the framework of evidence theory.

Shannon entropy or probabilistic information content (PIC) measure is traditionally used in evaluating PTs. The transformation having the lowest entropy or highest PIC is considered as the best one. This standpoint is questioned in this paper by comparing a PT based on uncertainty minimization with other available PTs. It shows experimentally that entropy or PIC is not comprehensive to evaluate a PT. To make a comprehensive evaluation, some new approaches are proposed by the joint use of PIC and the distance of evidence according to the value- and rank-based fusion. A pattern classification application oriented evaluation approach for PTs is also proposed. Some desired properties for PTs are also discussed.

At the same time, experiments were carried out at Reynolds numbers of 3000 and 5000, with the Grashof number varying over a wide range, by using pressurized nitrogen gas as a test fluid. In agreement with the prediction, buoyancy-induced impairment of heat transfer was correctly measured in the mixed convection regime.

Sub-cooled water enters the pipe from the lower end and heats up first in the near wall region leading to the generation of small bubbles. Further along the pipe larger and larger bubbles are generated by coalescence and evaporation. This leads to transitions of the two-phase flow patterns from bubbly to churn-turbulent and annular flow. The CFD simulation bases on the recently developed GEneralized TwO Phase flow (GENTOP) concept. It is a multi-field model using the Euler-Euler approach. It allows the consideration of different local flow morphologies including transitions between them.

The salient features of our formulation are: it consists of a geometrically derived kinematical model, physically based mechanical contact models and locally equilibrated equations governing the motion of the rigid particles; only one additional parameter d needs to be introduced in the model when compared with the standard discrete element method (DEM). In the study, precise definitions of pure sliding and pure rolling were proposed, and a decomposition of a general contact displacement was given in terms of these rolling and sliding components which are then linked to energy dissipation. The standard DEM assumption that grains are in contact at discrete points was here replaced by the assumption that grains are in contact over a width. By making the idealization that the grain contact width is continuously distributed with normal/tangential basic elements, we established a rolling contact model together with normal/tangential contact models, and also related the governing equations to local equilibrium. As an example of its application, the present model was incorporated into a DEM code to study the angle of internal friction / of the material. Fifty-four DEM simulations showed that / predicted by the novel model was increased in comparison to the standard DEM prediction, and may be closer to the values observed experimentally provided that the d\\textendash/ relationship established in this paper was used.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\4RV7TZ94\\\\2005-A novel discrete model for granular material incorporating rolling resistance.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111071,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2123},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1260,"entry":"@article{jiang2019new,\n  title = {A New Probability Transformation Method Based on a Correlation Coefficient of Belief Functions},\n  author = {Jiang, Wen and Huang, Chan and Deng, Xinyang},\n  year = {2019},\n  journal = {International Journal of Intelligent Systems},\n  volume = {34},\n  number = {6},\n  pages = {1337--1347},\n  publisher = {{Wiley Online Library}},\n  copyright = {8.9264},\n  lccn = {8.9924},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\WRT8W3XS\\\\2019-A new probability transformation method based on a correlation coefficient of.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111072,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2124},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1234,"entry":"@article{jiang2019novel,\n  title = {A Novel {{Z-network}} Model Based on {{Bayesian}} Network and {{Z-number}}},\n  author = {Jiang, Wen and Cao, Ying and Deng, Xinyang},\n  year = {2019},\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems},\n  volume = {28},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {1585--1599},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  copyright = {11.6369},\n  lccn = {12.2529}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111073,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2125},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1222,"entry":"@article{jirousek2018New,\n  title = {A New Definition of Entropy of Belief Functions in the {{Dempster}}\\textendash{{Shafer}} Theory},\n  author = {Jirou{\\v s}ek, Radim and Shenoy, Prakash P},\n  year = {2018},\n  journal = {International Journal of Approximate Reasoning},\n  volume = {92},\n  pages = {49--65},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  copyright = {3.5438},\n  lccn = {4.4522},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\9UFSCNM9\\\\Jiroušek 和 Shenoy - 2018 - A new definition of entropy of belief functions in.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111074,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2126},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":642,"entry":"@article{jouhara2016Threedimensional,\n  title = {Three-Dimensional {{CFD}} Simulation of Geyser Boiling in a Two-Phase Closed Thermosyphon},\n  author = {Jouhara, Hussam and Fadhl, Bandar and Wrobel, Luiz C.},\n  year = {2016},\n  month = oct,\n  journal = {International Journal of Hydrogen Energy},\n  volume = {41},\n  number = {37},\n  pages = {16463--16476},\n  issn = {03603199},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.02.038},\n  urldate = {2022-12-07},\n  abstract = {This paper examines the application of CFD modelling to simulate the complex multiphase characteristics inside a wickless heat pipe (thermosyphon).

The most popular rule of combination, called Dempster's rule of combination (or the orthogonal sum), has several interesting mathematical properties such as commutativity or associativity. However, combining belief functions with this operator implies normalizing the results by scaling them proportionally to the conflicting mass in order to keep some basic properties. Although this normalization seems logical, several authors have criticized it and some have proposed other solutions. In particular, Dempster's combination operator is a poor solution for the management of the conflict between the various information sources at the normalization step. Conflict management is a major problem especially during the fusion of many information sources. Indeed, the conflict increases with the number of information sources. That is why a strategy for re-assigning the conflicting mass is essential. In this paper, we define a formalism to describe a family of combination operators.

For high heat fluxes, the operating curve is smooth and independent from the orientation. To contribute to the analysis of these results, experiments were conducted at the scale of a single branch of a PHP. An oscillating motion was imposed to a single liquid plug surrounded by two vapour slugs in a capillary tube and high speed visualizations were performed. The test section was either adiabatic or heated. The adiabatic experiments brought to the fore the importance of dynamic contact angles in the flow and the dissymmetry between the advancing and receding contact angle. The non-adiabatic experiments showed that at low flux, the flow is disturbed by bubble nucleation, while at high heat flux, the main heat transfer mechanism is thin film evaporation, with a completely different thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour.},\n  copyright = {5.906},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {6.4650},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\JPGJV894\\\\2010-Experimental evidences of distinct heat transfer regimes in pulsating heat.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111139,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2142},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":30,"entry":"@article{Liu2006,\n  title = {Analyzing the Degree of Conflict among Belief Functions},\n  author = {Liu, Weiru},\n  year = {2006},\n  month = aug,\n  journal = {Artificial Intelligence},\n  volume = {170},\n  number = {11},\n  pages = {909--924},\n  issn = {00043702},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.artint.2006.05.002},\n  urldate = {2022-09-18},\n  abstract = {The study of alternative combination rules in DS theory when evidence is in conflict has emerged again recently as an interesting topic, especially in data/information fusion applications.

In practice, the multiple classifiers to combine can have different reliabilities and the proper reliability evaluation plays an important role in the fusion process for getting the best classification performance. We propose a new method for classifier fusion with contextual reliability evaluation (CFCRE) based on inner reliability and relative reliability concepts. The inner reliability, represented by a matrix, characterizes the probability of the object belonging to one class when it is classified to another class. The elements of this matrix are estimated from the K-nearest neighbors of the object. A cautious discounting rule is developed under belief functions framework to revise the classification result according to the inner reliability. The relative reliability is evaluated based on a new incompatibility measure which allows to reduce the level of conflict between the classifiers by applying the classical evidence discounting rule to each classifier before their combination. The inner reliability and relative reliability capture different aspects of the classification reliability. The discounted classification results are combined with Dempster\\textendash Shafer's rule for the final class decision making support. The performance of CF-CRE have been evaluated and compared with those of main classical fusion methods using real data sets. The experimental results show that CF-CRE can produce substantially higher accuracy than other fusion methods in general. Moreover, CF-CRE is robust to the changes of the number of nearest neighbors chosen for estimating the reliability matrix, which is appealing for the applications.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\Z4IBDNQT\\\\2018-Classifier Fusion With Contextual Reliability Evaluation.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111140,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2144},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1232,"entry":"@article{liu2019derive,\n  title = {Derive Knowledge of {{Z-number}} from the Perspective of {{Dempster}}\\textendash{{Shafer}} Evidence Theory},\n  author = {Liu, Qing and Tian, Ye and Kang, Bingyi},\n  year = {2019},\n  journal = {Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence},\n  volume = {85},\n  pages = {754--764},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  copyright = {6.6936},\n  lccn = {7.8024}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111140,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2145},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1230,"entry":"@article{liu2019risk,\n  title = {Risk Evaluation in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Based on {{D}} Numbers Theory},\n  author = {Liu, Baoyu and Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2019},\n  journal = {International Journal of Computers Communications \\& Control},\n  volume = {14},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {672--691},\n  copyright = {1.9261},\n  lccn = {2.6349}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111141,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2146},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1231,"entry":"@article{liu2020novel,\n  title = {A Novel Approach to Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making Problems Based on Linguistic {{D}} Numbers},\n  author = {Liu, Peide and Zhang, Xiaohong},\n  year = {2020},\n  journal = {Computational and Applied Mathematics},\n  volume = {39},\n  pages = {1--27},\n  publisher = {{Springer}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111141,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2147},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1008,"entry":"@misc{liu2021RankOne,\n  title = {Rank-{{One Prior}}: {{Toward Real-Time Scene Recovery}}},\n  shorttitle = {Rank-{{One Prior}}},\n  author = {Liu, Jun and Liu, Ryan Wen and Sun, Jianing and Zeng, Tieyong},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = apr,\n  number = {arXiv:2103.17126},\n  eprint = {2103.17126},\n  primaryclass = {cs},\n  publisher = {{arXiv}},\n  urldate = {2023-03-21},\n  abstract = {Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task for several practical applications, e.g., video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. To improve visual quality under different weather/imaging conditions, we propose a real-time light correction method to recover the degraded scenes in the cases of sandstorms, underwater, and haze.

Although the information volume of the probability distribution can be calculated by Shannon entropy, how to calculate the information of the mass function is still being explored. Recently, the concept of extropy was proposed by Lad et al. Based on extropy, the information volume of mass function is proposed in this paper. For a basic probability assignment function (BPA), if the focal elements of the frame of discernment (FOD) are all single elements, the information volume proposed in this paper is equal to the corresponding extropy. Otherwise, the information volume is greater than the corresponding extropy. Besides, when the cardinality of the FOD is identical, both the total uncertainty case and the mass function distribution of the maximum extropy have the same information volume. More precisely, the distribution of the latter can be regarded as the former obtained by decomposing the BPA once. Finally, the experiment proves that the maximum information volume increases with the increase in the cardinality of the FOD, and has the same limit value log2e as the maximum extropy.

The study used the Particle Flow Code (PFC) to simulate biaxial compression tests in granular materials. To study the effects of rolling resistance, a user-defined rolling resistance model was implemented in PFC. A series of parametric studies was performed to investigate the effects of different levels of rolling resistance on the stress\\textendash strain response and the emergence and development of shear bands in granular materials. The PFC models were also tested under a range of macro-mechanical parameters and boundary conditions. It is shown that rolling resistance affects the elastic, shear strength and dilation response of granular materials, and new relationships between rolling resistance and macroscopic elasticity, shear strength and dilation parameters are presented. It is also concluded that the rolling resistance has significant effects on the orientation, thickness and the timing of the occurrence of shear bands. The results reinforce prior conclusions by Oda et al. (Mech Mater 1:269\\textendash 283, 1982) on the importance of rolling resistance in promoting shear band formation in granular materials. It is shown that increased rolling resistance results in the development of columns of particles in granular materials during strain hardening process. The buckling of these columns of particles in narrow zones then leads to the development of shear bands. High gradients of particle rotation and large voids are produced within the shear band as a result of the buckling of the columns.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {arrester bed PFC模拟},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\25UPXFLQ\\\\2010-Comprehensive study of the effects of rolling resistance on the stress–strain.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111145,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2153},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":353,"entry":"@article{Moral-Garcia2020,\n  title = {Critique of Modified {{Deng}} Entropies under the Evidence Theory},\n  author = {{Moral-Garc{\\'i}a}, Seraf{\\'i}n and Abell{\\'a}n, Joaqu{\\'i}n},\n  year = {2020},\n  month = nov,\n  journal = {Chaos, Solitons \\& Fractals},\n  volume = {140},\n  pages = {110112},\n  issn = {0960-0779},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110112},\n  urldate = {2022-11-05},\n  abstract = {The Evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) has been frequently used in practical applications to deal with uncertainty or lack of information.

Examining energy transfer from base to perturbation flows, we show that the lift forces on bubbles play a key role in the bifurcations.

It consists in a closed capillary channel folded into several meanders, evacuated, and partially filled with a liquid and its vapor. One side is in thermal contact with a hot spot, the other with a cold spot. The oscillation of the liquid plugs and vapor bubbles spontaneously occurs after the heating beginning. The heat exchange takes place not only by latent heat transfer, but also by liquid convection. Both this advantage and the PHP structural simplicity make it competitive with respect to other kinds of heat pipes. However, the PHP operation is non-stationary and depends on many physical and material parameters. As a result, application of empirical correlations is quite unsuccessful. More sophisticated direct modeling is thus required. In this review, we present the past, present, and future perspectives of the theoretical PHP studies. The physical phenomena on the level of a single bubble and single liquid plug is addressed first. In this context, the modeling of the simplest, single branch PHP is described as a necessary first step toward the PHP understanding and model validation. The modeling of interaction between the bubbles and plugs (bubble generation and disappearance, plug evaporation) is discussed next. Finally, the state of the art of the physical modeling and simulation of the multi-turn PHP is reviewed and the difference between existing approaches is explained.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {one branch php,Ponyo's Heat Tube},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\MAJLCWV8\\\\2021-Physical principles and state-of-the-art of modeling of the pulsating heat pipe.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111148,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2165},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":376,"entry":"@article{Nittono2012,\n  title = {The {{Power}} of {{Kawaii}}: {{Viewing Cute Images Promotes}} a {{Careful Behavior}} and {{Narrows Attentional Focus}}},\n  shorttitle = {The {{Power}} of {{Kawaii}}},\n  author = {Nittono, Hiroshi and Fukushima, Michiko and Yano, Akihiro and Moriya, Hiroki},\n  editor = {Paterson, Kevin},\n  year = {2012},\n  month = sep,\n  journal = {PLoS ONE},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {9},\n  pages = {e46362},\n  issn = {1932-6203},\n  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0046362},\n  urldate = {2022-11-05},\n  abstract = {Kawaii (a Japanese word meaning ``cute'') things are popular because they produce positive feelings.

In this study, psychophysiological responses were compared between two types of kawaii pictures: human babies and animals (kawaii with baby schema) or objects such as desserts and dress accessories (kawaii without baby schema). Twenty female university students were asked to view various pictures twice. Both types of kawaii pictures were rated to be more pleasant than neutral pictures, elicited a greater activation of the zygomaticus major muscles associated with smiling, and were viewed for a longer period when the same pictures were presented again. The effect of baby schema appeared in the zygomaticus major muscle activity, which was greater for pictures with baby schema.

We conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter as well as a web survey experiment with both robot and human presenters.

First, we conducted a face-to-face experiment with a robot presenter where participants observed their presentations about an object to explain its characteristics. The results showed that participants who observed the robot's touch behaviors perceived the object to be more               kawaii               and thought that the robot also felt the object was more               kawaii               .

Based on these results, we next conducted a web survey experiment to investigate whether such knowledge about touching effects is applicable for human presenters. The results resembled those obtained when the presenter was a robot, i.e., viewing a touch behavior increased both the presenter's perceived feelings of               kawaii               toward the object and the participant's feelings of               kawaii               toward it. These results suggest that viewing the touch behaviors of others influenced the perceived emotional feelings toward both presenters and objects.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Users\\\\Jeffey\\\\OneDrive - std.uestc.edu.cn\\\\Obsidian Sync\\\\Working\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\2022-Kawaii emotions in presentations.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111200,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2170},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1257,"entry":"@article{pal1993Uncertainty,\n  title = {Uncertainty Measures for Evidential Reasoning {{II}}: {{A}} New Measure of Total Uncertainty},\n  shorttitle = {Uncertainty Measures for Evidential Reasoning {{II}}},\n  author = {Pal, Nikhil R. and Bezdek, James C. and Hemasinha, Rohan},\n  year = {1993},\n  month = jan,\n  journal = {International Journal of Approximate Reasoning},\n  volume = {8},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {1--16},\n  issn = {0888-613X},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0888-613X(05)80003-9},\n  urldate = {2023-03-26},\n  abstract = {In Part I we discussed limitations of two measures of global (non-fuzzy) uncertainty of Lamata and Moral, and a measure of total (non-fuzzy) uncertainty due to Klir and Ramer and established the need for a new measure.

Several theorems are proved about the new measure. Our measure is additive, and unlike other TU measures, has a unique maximum. The new measure reduces to Shannon's probabilistic entropy when the basic probability assignment focuses only on singletons. On the other hand, complete ignorance\\textemdash basic assignment focusing only on the entire set, as a whole\\textemdash reduces it to Hartley's measure of information.

However, under the framework of quantum mass function, existing distances cannot measure the difference. Hence, this paper formulates a new distance measure, referred to as the distance of the quantum mass functions. The purpose of this distance measure is to quantify the difference between quantum mass functions. It can be demonstrated mathematically that it is a strict distance measure that satisfies the nonnegativity, symmetry, definiteness, triangle inequality. The proposed distance measure is a generalization of the classical evidence distance, and it introduces the concept of Minkowski distance as well. It is therefore not only able to reflects the difference of discord and non-specificity in the mass functions, but it also has the advantage of Minkowski distance, as well as high compatibility. Moreover, A number of numerical examples are also provided to illustrate its properties and advantages. Using the proposed distance measure, we design a new information fusion method based on the discount coefficient within a complex framework. As a further investigation, the proposed fusion method is applied to several data sets experiments and results indicate that compared to other methods, it has a certain potential in the field of multi-source information fusion under the framework of evidence theory.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\2DDQSL8Q\\\\2022-A distance of quantum mass function and its application in multi-source.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111201,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2173},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1245,"entry":"@article{pan2023complex,\n  title = {Complex-Valued Deng Entropy},\n  author = {Pan, Lipeng and Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2023},\n  journal = {Applied Intelligence},\n  pages = {10.1007/s10489-023-04573-w},\n  copyright = {4.7603},\n  lccn = {5.0187}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111202,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2174},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1263,"entry":"@article{pan2023evidential,\n  title = {Evidential Markov Decision-Making Model Based on Belief Entropy to Predict Interference Effects},\n  author = {Pan, Lipeng and Gao, Xiaozhuan},\n  year = {2023},\n  journal = {Information Sciences},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111203,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2175},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1236,"entry":"@article{pawlak1982rough,\n  title = {Rough Sets},\n  author = {Pawlak, Zdzis{\\l}aw},\n  year = {1982},\n  journal = {International journal of computer \\& information sciences},\n  volume = {11},\n  pages = {341--356},\n  publisher = {{Springer}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111204,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2176},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":449,"entry":"@article{paz2015Effect,\n  title = {Effect of Heating Surface Morphology on the Size of Bubbles during the Subcooled Flow Boiling of Water at Low Pressure},\n  author = {Paz, C. and Conde, M. and Porteiro, J. and Concheiro, M.},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = oct,\n  journal = {International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer},\n  volume = {89},\n  pages = {770--782},\n  issn = {00179310},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.06.003},\n  urldate = {2022-11-17},\n  abstract = {An experimental investigation on the forced convective subcooled flow boiling of water was carried out using image processing.

The proposed model offers a versatile and comprehensive analysis tool which is relatively simple.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\XQ5G2YLB\\\\1987-Modeling of the Two-Phase Closed Thermosyphon.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111229,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2185},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1350,"entry":"@inproceedings{richter2022sensor,\n  title = {Sensor Data Fusion in Top-View Grid Maps Using Evidential Reasoning with Advanced Conflict Resolution},\n  booktitle = {2022 25th International Conference on Information Fusion ({{FUSION}})},\n  author = {Richter, Sven and Bieder, Frank and Wirges, Sascha and Kinzig, Christian and Stiller, Christoph},\n  year = {2022},\n  pages = {1--7},\n  organization = {{IEEE}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111236,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2186},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":521,"entry":"@article{rorato2021Imagebased,\n  title = {Image-Based Calibration of Rolling Resistance in Discrete Element Models of Sand},\n  author = {Rorato, R. and Arroyo, M. and Gens, A. and And{\\`o}, E. and Viggiani, G.},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = mar,\n  journal = {Computers and Geotechnics},\n  volume = {131},\n  pages = {103929},\n  issn = {0266352X},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103929},\n  urldate = {2022-11-22},\n  abstract = {Models that introduce rolling resistance at the contact are widely employed in simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) to indirectly represent particle shape effects. This approach offers substantial compu\\- tational benefits at the price of increased calibration complexity. This work proposes a method to simplify calibration of rolling resistance. The key element is an empirical relation between a contact parameter (rolling friction) and a 3D grain shape descriptor (true sphericity). Values of true sphericity can be obtained by image analysis of the grains, either directly by 3D acquisition or by correlation with simpler-to-obtain 2D shape measures. Evaluation of rolling friction is thus made independent from that of other model parameters. As an extra benefit, the variability of grain shape in natural sands can be directly mapped into the discrete model. A mapping between rolling friction and true sphericity is calibrated using specimen-scale and grain scale results from two triaxial compression tests on Hostun sand and Caicos ooids. The mapping is validated using different triaxial tests from the same sands and from other reference sands (Ottawa, Ticino). In the case of Ticino grainshape acquisition is made in 2D, using an ordinary table scanner. The results obtained support this direct cali\\- bration procedure.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\Y7P2KGVK\\\\2021-Image-based calibration of rolling resistance in discrete element models of sand.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111237,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2187},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1010,"entry":"@article{sahu2021Single,\n  title = {Single Image Dehazing Using a New Color Channel},\n  author = {Sahu, Geet and Seal, Ayan and Krejcar, Ondrej and Yazidi, Anis},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = jan,\n  journal = {Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation},\n  volume = {74},\n  pages = {103008},\n  issn = {10473203},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jvcir.2020.103008},\n  urldate = {2023-03-21},\n  abstract = {Images with hazy scene suffer from low-contrast, which reduces the visible quality of the scene, thus making object detection a more challenging task. Low-contrast can result from foggy weather conditions during image acquisition. Dehazing is a process of removal of haze from the photography of a hazy scene. Single-image dehazing based on dark channel priors are well-known techniques in this field. However, the performance of such techniques is limited to priors or constraints. Moreover, this type of method fails when images have sky-region. So, a method is proposed, which can restore the visibility of hazy images. First, a hazy image is divided into blocks of size 32 \\texttimes{} 32, then the score of each block is calculated to select a block having the highest score. Atmospheric light is calculated from the selected block. A new color channel is considered to remove atmospheric scattering, obtained channel value and atmospheric light are then used to calculate the transmission map in the second step. Third, radiance is computed using a transmission map and atmospheric light. The illumination scaling factor is adopted to enhance the quality of a dehazed image in the final step. Experiments are performed on six datasets namely, I-HAZE, O-HAZE, BSDS500, FRIDA, RESIDE dataset and natural images from Google. The proposed method is compared against 11 state-of-the-art methods. The performance is analyzed using fourteen quantitative evaluation metrics. All the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in most of the cases.},\n  copyright = {2.7112},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {2.8869},\n  keywords = {haze removal,image enhancement,single-image dehazing},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\KY2ET6IU\\\\2021-Single image dehazing using a new color channel.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111238,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2188},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1243,"entry":"@book{shafer1976mathematical,\n  title = {A Mathematical Theory of Evidence},\n  author = {Shafer, Glenn},\n  year = {1976},\n  volume = {42},\n  publisher = {{Princeton university press}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111240,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2189},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1246,"entry":"@article{shannon1948mathematical,\n  title = {A Mathematical Theory of Communication},\n  author = {Shannon, Claude E},\n  year = {1948},\n  journal = {The Bell system technical journal},\n  volume = {27},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {379--423},\n  publisher = {{Nokia Bell Labs}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111241,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2190},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":175,"entry":"@article{sherman2009Viewing,\n  title = {Viewing Cute Images Increases Behavioral Carefulness.},\n  author = {Sherman, Gary D. and Haidt, Jonathan and Coan, James A.},\n  year = {2009},\n  journal = {Emotion},\n  volume = {9},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {282--286},\n  issn = {1931-1516, 1528-3542},\n  doi = {10.1037/a0014904},\n  urldate = {2022-10-30},\n  abstract = {Infantile physical morphology\\textemdash marked by its ``cuteness''\\textemdash is thought to be a potent elicitor of caregiving, yet little is known about how cuteness may shape immediate behavior.

It means the power set extends the event space in probability theory into all possible combination of the single basic event. From the view of power set, all subsets or all combination of basic events, are created equal. These subsets are assigned with the mass function, whose uncertainty can be measured by Deng entropy.

Currently, the existed uncertainty measures in the DST framework are limited to the closed world where the frame of discernment (FOD) is assumed to be complete. To address this issue, this paper focuses on extending a belief entropy to the open world by considering the uncertain information represented as the FOD and the nonzero mass function of the empty set simultaneously. An extension to Deng's entropy in the open world assumption (EDEOW) is proposed as a generalization of the Deng's entropy and it can be degenerated to the Deng entropy in the closed world wherever necessary. In order to test the reasonability and effectiveness of the extended belief entropy, an EDEOW-based information fusion approach is proposed and applied to sensor data fusion under uncertainty circumstance. The experimental results verify the usefulness and applicability of the extended measure as well as the modified sensor data fusion method. In addition, a few open issues still exist in the current work: the necessary properties for a belief entropy in the open world assumption, whether there exists a belief entropy that satisfies all the existed properties, and what is the most proper fusion frame for sensor data fusion under uncertainty.},\n  copyright = {4.0501},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {3.8470},\n  keywords = {closed world,Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST),Deng entropy,extended belief entropy,open world,sensor data fusion,uncertainty measure},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\LIPDLRPG\\\\2018-An Extension to Deng’s Entropy in the Open World Assumption with an Application.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111322,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2198},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":413,"entry":"@article{todoranInformation,\n  title = {Information Quality Evaluation in Fusion Systems},\n  author = {Todoran, Ion-George and Lecornu, Laurent and Khenchaf, Ali and Caillec, Jean-Marc Le},\n  pages = {8},\n  abstract = {Advances in new information and communication technology have considerably increased the quantity of available data and permitted the implementation of more and more complex processing techniques.

We propose a definition of the rolling resistance force and torque, and carry out experiments with a basketball and medicine ball rolling on a bed of gravel to measure the corresponding rolling resistance coefficients. These experiments reveal, in good agreement with literature, coefficients that are velocityindependent, and show that little to no plowing of the spheres into the granular substrate occurs. This indicates a regime of motion distinctly different from those treated in previous works. A simplified model correctly predicts the velocity independence and suggests an inverse dependence of the rolling resistance coefficient on the reduced inertia of the ball.

Firstly, color channel compensation and piece-wise affine transform balance the aberrant pixels obtained by camera and remove color cast. Then, multi-path fusion comprising of underexposure and contrast-enhanced inputs is used for visibility enhancement, where saturation and Laplacian contrast are measured as weight maps and constructed for Gaussian pyramids. In order to reduce block effects and artifacts of the reconstructed image, we introduce the multi-scale strategy for each path. Experimental results of both synthetic and real-world sandstorm images demonstrate that the proposed color balance method features high computational efficiency and performs much better than comparative methods in terms of image quality.

In this paper, the interval-valued stochastic process is modeled with the basic belief assignment in an ordered frame of discernment and the corresponding belief entropy rate is proposed to measure its uncertainty. Two common stochastic processes are discussed. The first is the case of independent identically distributed stochastic processes, where the belief entropy rate is formally the same as the Shannon entropy rate. The second is Markov processes. We construct the evidential Markov chain and calculate its belief entropy rate. Compared with the Shannon entropy rate, the belief entropy rate is easier to implement the Markov chains. By validating in real dataset, the proposed method can better deal with interval information with stronger practicability. When encountering tiny disturbances, the variance of the Shannon entropy rate is more than 50 times the variance of the belief entropy rate, which reflects the stronger robustness of the belief entropy rate.},\n  copyright = {4.7603},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {5.0187},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\6LCQDP5N\\\\Wang 等 - 2023 - Belief entropy rate a method to measure the uncer.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111331,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2207},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":59,"entry":"@article{Wu2022,\n  title = {Exponential Negation of a Probability Distribution},\n  author = {Wu, Qinyuan and Deng, Yong and Xiong, Neal},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = mar,\n  journal = {Soft Computing},\n  volume = {26},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {2147--2156},\n  issn = {1432-7643, 1433-7479},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00500-021-06658-5},\n  urldate = {2022-09-20},\n  abstract = {Negation operation is important in intelligent information processing.

Because of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling and processing the uncertain information regardless of prior probabilities, Dempster\\textendash Shafer evidence theory is widely applied in a variety of fields of information fusion. However, counter-intuitive results may come out when fusing the highly conflicting evidences. In order to deal with this problem, a novel method for multi-sensor data fusion based on a new belief divergence measure of evidences and the belief entropy was proposed. First, a new Belief Jensen\\textendash Shannon divergence is devised to measure the discrepancy and conflict degree between the evidences; then, the credibility degree can be obtained to represent the reliability of the evidences. Next, considering the uncertainties of the evidences, the information volume of the evidences are measured by making use of the belief entropy to indicate the relative importance of the evidences. Afterwards, the credibility degree of each evidence is modified by taking advantage of the quantitative information volume which will be utilized to obtain an appropriate weight in terms of each evidence. Ultimately, the final weights of the evidences are applied to adjust the bodies of the evidences before using the Dempster's combination rule. A numerical example is illustrated that the proposed method is feasible and effective in handling the conflicting evidences, where the belief value of target increases to 99.05\\%. Furthermore, an application in fault diagnosis is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

In this study, we asked what systems are activated for early-stage romantic love in Easterners, specifically Chinese participants? Are these activations affected by individual differences within a cultural context of Traditionality and Modernity? Also, are these brain activations correlated with later satisfaction in the relationship? In Beijing, we used the same procedure used by Aron et al. (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327\\textendash 337). The stimuli for 18 Chinese participants were a picture of the face of their beloved, the face of a familiar acquaintance, and a countback task. We found significant activations specific to the beloved in the reward and motivation systems, particularly, the ventral tegmental area and the caudate. The mid-orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum were also activated, whereas amygdala, medial orbitofrontal, and medial accumbens activity were decreased relative to the familiar acquaintance. Self-reported Traditionality and Modernity scores were each positively correlated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, although in different regions and sides of the brain. Activity in the subgenual area and the superior frontal gyrus was associated with higher relationship happiness at 18-month follow-up. Our results show that midbrain dopamine-rich reward/motivation systems were activated by early-stage romantic love in Chinese participants, as found by other studies.

Nowadays, the types and updates of data are becoming more multifarious and frequent, which bring new challenges for information fusion to deal with the multi-source data. Consequently, the construction of MSIF models suitable for different scenarios and the application of different fusion technologies are the core problems that need to be solved urgently. Rough set theory (RST) provides a computing paradigm for uncertain data modeling and reasoning, especially for classification issues with noisy, inaccurate or incomplete data. Furthermore, due to the rapid development of MSIF in recent years, the methodologies of learning under RST are becoming increasingly mature and systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in the literature. In order to better clarify the approaches and application of MSIF in RST research community, this paper reviews the existing models and technologies from the perspectives of MSIF model (i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous MSIF model), multi-view rough sets information fusion model (i.e., multi-granulation, multi-scale and multi-view decisions information fusion models), parallel computing information fusion model, incremental learning fusion technology and cluster ensembles fusion technology. Finally, RST based MSIF related research directions and challenges are also covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art understanding in specialized literature, this survey will directly help researchers understand the research developments of MSIF under RST.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Cluster ensembles,Homogeneous and heterogeneous MSIF,Incremental learning,Multi-source information fusion,Multi-view rough sets,Parallel computing,Rough set theory},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\567FT36S\\\\2021-Multi-source information fusion based on rough set theory.pdf;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\M696M88B\\\\@Zhang2021.md}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111334,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2217},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":827,"entry":"@article{Zhang2021a,\n  title = {A {{New Total Uncertainty Measure}} from {{A Perspective}} of {{Maximum Entropy Requirement}}},\n  author = {Zhang, Yu and Huang, Fanghui and Deng, Xinyang and Jiang, Wen},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = aug,\n  journal = {Entropy},\n  volume = {23},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {1061},\n  issn = {1099-4300},\n  doi = {10.3390/e23081061},\n  urldate = {2022-12-27},\n  abstract = {The Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) is an information fusion framework and widely used in many fields. However, the uncertainty measure of a basic probability assignment (BPA) is still an open issue in DST. There are many methods to quantify the uncertainty of BPAs. However, the existing methods have some limitations. In this paper, a new total uncertainty measure from a perspective of maximum entropy requirement is proposed. The proposed method can measure both dissonance and non-specificity in BPA, which includes two components. The first component is consistent with Yager's dissonance measure. The second component is the non-specificity measurement with different functions. We also prove the desirable properties of the proposed method. Besides, numerical examples and applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed total uncertainty measure.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\4LT3VJ24\\\\2021-A New Total Uncertainty Measure from A Perspective of Maximum Entropy2.pdf;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\F58G8SG7\\\\Zhang2021a - 注释 (2023119 下午54005).md;E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\W4XIFKEX\\\\@Zhang2021a.md}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111334,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2218},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1011,"entry":"@article{zhang2021Single,\n  title = {Single Image Dehazing Based on Bright Channel Prior Model and Saliency Analysis Strategy},\n  author = {Zhang, Libao and Wang, Shan and Wang, Xiaohan},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = apr,\n  journal = {IET Image Processing},\n  volume = {15},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {1023--1031},\n  issn = {1751-9659, 1751-9667},\n  doi = {10.1049/ipr2.12082},\n  urldate = {2023-03-21},\n  abstract = {Haze is a common atmospheric phenomenon that causes poor visibility in outdoor images, which greatly limits image application in later stages. Therefore, haze removal has become the first and most indispensable step when dealing with degraded images. In this paper, we propose a novel bright channel prior (BCP) model and a saliency analysis strategy for haze removal. First, we obtain a more robust and accurate atmospheric light by a superpixelbased dark channel method. Second, we utilize the dark channel prior (DCP) to handle dark regions in hazy images. However, the DCP often mistakes white regions for opaque haze and thus causes serious colour distortion and halo effects. To solve this problem, a new BCP is proposed to accurately estimate the transmission of bright regions in hazy images. Third, we fuse the DCP and BCP using a multiscale fusion strategy with Laplacian pyramid representation to gain the correct transmission information for both bright and dark regions. Finally, a novel saliency analysis strategy for transmission refinement is proposed, so that the texture details can remain present to the greatest extent in the restored images. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed method performs well in restoring images containing bright objects.},\n  copyright = {1.9592},\n  langid = {english},\n  lccn = {1.7729},\n  keywords = {bright channel prior,haze removal,image restoration},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\HQAZH7AV\\\\2021-Single image dehazing based on bright channel prior model and saliency analysis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111339,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2219},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1337,"entry":"@inproceedings{zheng2021UltraHighDefinition,\n  title = {Ultra-{{High-Definition Image Dehazing}} via {{Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning}}},\n  booktitle = {2021 {{IEEE}}/{{CVF Conference}} on {{Computer Vision}} and {{Pattern Recognition}} ({{CVPR}})},\n  author = {Zheng, Zhuoran and Ren, Wenqi and Cao, Xiaochun and Hu, Xiaobin and Wang, Tao and Song, Fenglong and Jia, Xiuyi},\n  year = {2021},\n  month = jun,\n  pages = {16180--16189},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  address = {{Nashville, TN, USA}},\n  doi = {10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01592},\n  urldate = {2023-03-30},\n  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in the single image dehazing task. Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-highdefinition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The first CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then fits locallyaffine models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the highquality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks.},\n  isbn = {978-1-66544-509-2},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {E\\:\\\\VSCODE\\\\Markdown\\\\glossary\\\\content\\\\private\\\\08-Assets\\\\pdfs\\\\zotero data\\\\storage\\\\5ZJA575N\\\\2021-Ultra-High-Definition Image Dehazing via Multi-Guided Bilateral Learning.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1681608111340,"version":0,"updated":1681608111428},"$loki":2220},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibTeX":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"off","DOIandURL":"both","itemID":229,"entry":"@misc{Zhou2020,\n  title = {Higher Order Information Volume of Mass Function},\n  author = {Zhou, Qianli and Deng, Yong},\n  year = {2020},\n  month = dec,\n  number = {arXiv:2012.07507},\n  eprint = {2012.07507},\n  primaryclass = {cs, math},\n  publisher = {{arXiv}},\n  urldate = {2022-11-04},\n  abstract = {For a certain moment, the information volume represented in a probability space can be accurately measured by Shannon entropy.

In order to utilize BPA to practical decision-making, pignistic probability transformation of BPA is a significant method. In the paper, we simulate the pignistic probability transformation (PPT) process based on the fractal idea, which describes PPT process in detail and shows the process of information volume changes during transformation intuitively.
