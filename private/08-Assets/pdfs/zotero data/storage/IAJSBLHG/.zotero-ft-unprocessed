In this paper, we study the consequences of a frame of discernment consisting of ordered elements on belief functions. This leads us to redefine the power space and the union of ordered elements for the disjunctive combination. We also study distances on ordered elements and their use. In particular, from a membership function, we redefine the cardinality of the intersection of ordered elements, considering them fuzzy. \n \n \n##  Zotero links \n* [Local library](zotero://select/items/1_NPZ4A2W7) \n* [Cloud library](http://zotero.org/users/10099416/items/NPZ4A2W7) \n \n"}
