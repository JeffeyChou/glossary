## Abstract

We present a measure of performance (MOP) for identi庐cation algorithms based on the evidential theory of Dempster卤Shafer. As an MOP, we introduce a principled distance between two basic probability assignments (BPAs) (or two bodies of evidence) based on a quanti庐cation of the similarity between sets. We give a geometrical interpretation of BPA and show that the proposed distance satis庐es all the requirements for a metric. We also show the link with the quanti庐cation of Dempster's weight of con炉ict proposed by George and Pal. We compare this MOP to that described by Fixsen and Mahler and illustrate the behaviors of the two MOPs with numerical examples. 脫 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
