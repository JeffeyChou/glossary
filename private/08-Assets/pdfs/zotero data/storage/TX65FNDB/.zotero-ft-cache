## Abstract

Pascal鈥檚 triangle is a mathematical triangular form of binomial coef铿乧ients, from which Fibonacci number sequence and golden ratio can be obtained. Recently, the relations between Pascal鈥檚 triangle and maximum Deng entropy are studied and presented. A straightforward idea comes: if we design a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, what would the generated number sequence and the corresponding ratio be like? Hence, this paper proposes a triangle based on maximum Deng entropy, named as the maximum Deng entropy triangle (MDET). Besides, the number sequences based on MDET are investigated. Next, the general term for the MDET sequence is presented and the ratio in MDET sequence is analyzed. We prove that, under the con鈭� dition of n 鈫� 鈭�, the ratio in right MDET sequence converges to silver ratio 1 + 2.
