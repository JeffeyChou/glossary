The New York Times describes these fines as some of the largest that the FCC has sought in years. \n \nThe FCC’s Enforcement Bureau opened an investigation after a May 2018 New York Times article alleged that Missouri Sheriff Cory Hutcheson used a location-finding service operated by Securus, one of the largest providers of communications services to correctional facilities, to access the location information of numerous cellular customers without their authorization or consent from 2014 to 2017. Securus often provided location information to police, including Sheriff Hutcheson, without receiving proper documentation of authorization. The FCC’s investigation revealed that in some cases, Hutcheson had even provided Securus with “irrelevant documents like his health insurance policy, [and] his auto insurance policy” as documentation of his authorization to access wireless customer information. \n \nAccording to the New York Times , the use of location data is largely unregulated, but the telecommunications industry is subject to more stringent regulations than technology companies are. The FCC has interpreted the Telecommunications Act to require carriers to “take reasonable measures to discover and protect against attempts to gain unauthorized access to [location] data” and to “obtain affirmative, express consent from a customer before using, disclosing, or allowing access to this data.” \n \nBased on the findings of the FCC’s investigation, the FCC has proposed actions formally called Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment (“NALs”). NALs advise involved parties on how they have apparently violated the law and set forth a proposed monetary penalty. The FCC has proposed to impose fines on T-Mobile of more than $91 million; AT&T of more than $57 million; Verizon of more than $48 million; and Sprint of more than $12 million. The sizes of these proposed fines differ based on the number of buyers to whom and the length of time for which each carrier sold access to its customers’ location information without reasonable safeguards. \n \nThe allegations and fines are not final. The reprimanded carriers will be given an opportunity to respond and the FCC will consider their evidence and legal arguments before taking further action. T-Mobile has already announced that it will dispute the FCC’s fines. After these arguments, the FCC may change the actions outlined in its NALs but may not increase the fines. \n \nNot everyone is satisfied with the NALs. Privacy advocates at the FCC and on Capitol Hill have directly objected to the fines because they were too late and too small. TechCrunch asserts that $200M divided among several billion-dollar communications organizations amounts to “peanuts” and argues that the FCC did not adequately investigate the impact of the cellular carriers’ actions. Senator Ron Wyden, who raised concerns about the cellular carriers’ data-sharing in a 2018 letter to the FCC , stated that the fines are “comically inadequate” to deter future violations. \n \nCynthia Ahmed is a 2L at Harvard Law School. \nRelated Articles \n\t\t\t \nThe TikTok Bill Isn’t Only About TikTok... \tAmsterdam Court Rules Facebook Ireland Unlawfully ... \tHouse Passes HR 140, Protecting Speech from Govern... \tNew Hampshire Joins a Growing Number of States Con... \nRecent Articles \nApril 26, 2023 The TikTok Bill Isn’t Only About TikTok \nApril 24, 2023 Amsterdam Court Rules Facebook Ireland Unlawfully Processed Dutch Users’ Data \nApril 12, 2023 House Passes HR 140, Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act \nApril 06, 2023 ChatGPT and Text Fakes—Sensible Policy to Balance Growth and Risk \nJOLT Sponsors \n \n    Cooley \n    Desmarais \n    Fenwick & West \n    Finnegan \n    Fish & Richardson \n    Gunderson Dettmer \n    Irell & Manella \n    Kirkland & Ellis \n    Knobbe Martens \n    Latham & Watkins \n    Morrison & Foerster \n    Quinn Emanuel \n    Sidley Austin \n    White & Case \n    Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati \n    Wolf Greenfield \n \nContact Information \n \nHarvard Law School \nWasserstein Hall, Suite 3050 \n1585 Massachusetts Ave \nCambridge, MA 02138 \njolt@mail.law.harvard.edu \nCopyright © 2023 Harvard Journal of Law and Technology \nlogo icon \n↻ \n"}
