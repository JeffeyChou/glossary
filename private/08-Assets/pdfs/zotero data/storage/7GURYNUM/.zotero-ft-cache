Abstract

How to efficient modelling uncertain information is still an open issue. Many methods such as probability theory, fuzzy sets theory, Dempster-Shafer theory, and possibility theory, have been proposed. All the previous methods have some desirable properties while with some shortcomings. In this paper, a new method, named as D numbers is proposed to handle uncertain information. It can be seen a special kind of random sets. The arithmetic operations on D numbers are developed. An numerical example is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2012 Binary Information Press.
