Using the credentials to exploit weaknesses in Target's system, the attackers gained access to a customer service database, installed malware on the system and captured full names, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card numbers, credit card verification codes, and other sensitive data. \n \nAlong with affecting 41 million customer payment card accounts, the breach affected contact information for more than 60 million Target customers. \n \n\"Companies across sectors should be taking their data security policies and procedures seriously. Not doing so potentially exposes sensitive client and consumer information to hackers,\" said a statement issued by Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen, who led the investigation along with Illinois counterpart Lisa Madigan. \n \n  \n \nTarget: Data stolen from up to 70 million customers \n \nTarget previously provided free credit monitoring services for consumers affected by the breach. As part of a $10 million class-action lawsuit settlement reached in 2015, the company also agreed to pay up to $10,000 to consumers with evidence they suffered losses from the data breach. \n \n  \n \nFew Target victims to benefit from settlement \n \nTuesday, the company said it had worked with the state investigators to address claims related to the embarrassing episode. \n \n\"We're pleased to bring this issue to a resolution for everyone involved,\" the Minneapolis-based company said in a written statement. Costs of the settlement are already reflected in liability reserves that Target has previously disclosed, the company added. \n \nTerms of the agreement require Target to: \n \n    Develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program \n    Employ an executive or officer responsible for executing the program \n    Hire an independent expert to conduct a security assessment \n    Maintain and support data security software on the company's network \n    Segregate the cardholder data from the rest of the network \n    Take steps to control network access, including password rotation policies and two-factor authentication. \n \nAs part of the settlement, the states will use their respective shares of the Target payment for attorney fees and other investigation costs, as well as consumer protection law enforcement funds, consumer education or other purposes. \n \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc \nAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Settings \nContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local Business \nNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS \n10Best Reviewed Jobs Sports Weekly Studio Gannett USA TODAY Sports+ Classifieds Coupons Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans \n© 2023 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC. \n↻ \nlogo icon \n"}
