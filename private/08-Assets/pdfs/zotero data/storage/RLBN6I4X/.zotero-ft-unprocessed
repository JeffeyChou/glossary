You may review the Final Approval Order and Final Order and Judgment by clicking here .   \n \nSettlement appeals have been resolved and the Settlement is now effective.  Per the terms of the Settlement, claimants who submitted a valid claim for credit monitoring services were sent an email or letter by mail providing information on how to activate credit monitoring services with Experian.  If you did not do so by the deadline provided in the email or letter, the time to activate Experian Credit Monitoring Services has now passed. \n \nSettlement benefits for eligible out-of-pocket losses and time spent began issuing in mid-December 2022. \n \nExtended Claims Period claims for time spent and out-of-pocket losses are under review.  You will be contacted if additional information is needed regarding your claim(s). \n  \n \nIn September of 2017, Equifax announced it experienced a data breach, which impacted the personal information of approximately 147 million people.  A federal court approved a class action Settlement that resolves lawsuits brought by consumers after the data breach.  Equifax denied any wrongdoing and no judgment or finding of wrongdoing was made. \n \nIf you are a Class Member, the deadline to file Initial Claims Period claim(s) for free credit monitoring or up to $125 cash payment and other cash reimbursement passed on January 22, 2020.  \n \nThe Settlement is now effective. If you requested a cash benefit during the Initial Claims Period, the amount you receive may be significantly reduced depending on how many valid claims are submitted by other class members. Based on the number of potentially valid claims that have been submitted to date, payments for time spent and alternative compensation of up to $125 likely will be substantially lowered and will be distributed on a proportional basis if the Settlement becomes effective. Depending on the number of valid claims filed, the amount you receive may be a small percentage of your initial claim. \n \n  \n \nExtended Claims Period Claims \n \nIf you were impacted by the Equifax data breach, you may seek reimbursement for valid Out-of-Pocket losses or Time Spent ( excluding losses of money and time associated with freezing or unfreezing credit reports or purchasing credit monitoring or identity theft protection ) incurred during the Extended Claims Period if you have not received reimbursement for the claimed loss through other means. \n \nTo be eligible, your claim for Out-of-Pocket Losses or Time Spent must occur between January 23, 2020 and January 22, 2024 (the “Extended Claims Period”). \n  \n \nFile an Extended Claims Period Claim Today \n \n  \n \nDuring the Extended Claims Period, impacted class members may submit claim(s) for cash reimbursement.
