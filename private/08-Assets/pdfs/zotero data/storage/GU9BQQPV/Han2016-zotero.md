## Abstract

The transformation of belief function into probability is one of the most important and common ways for decision making under the framework of evidence theory. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of such probability transformations (PTs), which are crucial for their proper applications and the design of new ones. Shannon entropy or probabilistic information content (PIC) measure is traditionally used in evaluating PTs. The transformation having the lowest entropy or highest PIC is considered as the best one. This standpoint is questioned in this paper by comparing a PT based on uncertainty minimization with other available PTs. It shows experimentally that entropy or PIC is not comprehensive to evaluate a PT. To make a comprehensive evaluation, some new approaches are proposed by the joint use of PIC and the distance of evidence according to the value- and rank-based fusion. A pattern classiÔ¨Åcation application oriented evaluation approach for PTs is also proposed. Some desired properties for PTs are also discussed. Experimental results and related analysis are provided to show the rationality of the new evaluation approaches.
