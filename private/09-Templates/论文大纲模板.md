The big picture:  
Resist the temptation to correct and edit. 
Focus on completing the first draft, not the perfect draft.  
The "Algorithm"  
    1. Just get sated don't procrastinate.  
    2. Outline including all the figures and tables  
    3. Do not write introduction at first.  
    4. Begin with the experimental section  
    5. Write results and discussion  
    6. Convert the first draft into clear concise and coherent English  
    7. Write the conclusions in the numbered format  
    8. Write the introduction: What is the purpose of the study? Collect the relevant essential background information

Outline, including all your figures and tables → Experimental result and discussion → convert it into a more clear and coherent English. → Conclusion → Introduction →abstract →title → reference → review and polish your work.
