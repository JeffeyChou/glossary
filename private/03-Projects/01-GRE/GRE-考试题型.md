### Multiple-choice Questions: Select One Answer Choice

#### Description

  These are the traditional multiple-choice questions with five answer choices of which you must select one
  
#### Tips

> - **Read all the answer choices before making your selection**, even if you think you know what the answer is in advance.
> - **Don't be misled by answer choices that are only partially true or only partially answer the question**. The correct answer is the one that most accurately and most completely answers the question posed. Be careful also not to pick an answer choice simply because it is a true statement.
> - **Pay attention to context**. When the question asks about the meaning of a word in the passage, be sure that the answer choice you select correctly represents the way the word is being used in the passage. Many words have quite different meanings in different contexts.

### Multiple-choice questions-select one or more answer choices

#### Description

  These provide three answer choices and ask you to select all that are correct; one, two, or all three of the answer choices may be correct. To gain credit for these questions, you must select all the correct answers, and only those; there is no credit for partially correct answers. These questions are marked with square boxes beside the answer choices, not circles or ovals.


#### Tips

> - **Evaluate each answer choice separately on its own merits**. When evaluating one answer choice, do not take the others into account.
> - **Make sure the answer choice you pick accurately and completely answers the question posed**. Be careful not to be misled by answer choices that are only partially true or only partially answer the question. Be careful also not to pick an answer choice simply because it is a true statement.
> - **Do not be disturbed if you think all three answer choices are correct**. Questions of this type can have three correct answer choices.


### Reading Comprehension Questions: Select-in-Passage

#### Description

  The question asks you to click on the sentence in the passage that meets a certain description. To answer the question, choose one of the sentences and click on it; clicking anywhere on a sentence will highlight it. In longer passages, the question will usually apply to only one or two specified paragraphs, marked by an arrow (→); clicking on a sentence elsewhere in the passage will not highlight it.


#### Tips

> - **Be careful to evaluate each of the relevant sentences in the passage separately before selecting your answer**. Do not evaluate any sentences that are outside the paragraphs under consideration.
> - **Do not select a sentence if the description given in the question only partially applies**. A correct answer choice must accurately match the description in the question. Note, however, that the description need not be complete, that is, there may be aspects of the sentence that are not fully described in the question

Text Completion Questions

### Blank Format Choice

#### Description

  As mentioned above, skilled readers do not simply absorb the information presented on the page; instead, they maintain a constant attitude of interpretation and evaluation, reasoning from what they have read so far to create a picture of the whole and revising that picture as they go. Text Completion questions test this ability by omitting crucial words from short passages and asking the test taker to use the remaining information in the passage as a basis for selecting words or short phrases to fill the blanks and create a coherent, meaningful whole.


#### Tips

  Do not merely try to consider each possible combination of answers; doing so will take too long and is open to error. Instead, try to analyze the passage in the following way:


> - **Read through the passage to get an overall sense of it.**
> - **Identify words or phrases that seem particularly significant,** either because they emphasize the structure of the passage (words like although or moreover) or because they are central to understanding what the passage is about.
> - **Think up your own words for the blanks.** Try to fill in the blanks with words or phrases that seem to you to fit and then see if similar words are offered among the answer choices.
> - **Do not assume that the first blank is the one that should be filled first.** Perhaps one of the other blanks is easier to fill first. Select your choice for that blank, and then see whether you can complete another blank. If none of the choices for the other blank seem to make sense, go back and reconsider your first selection.
> - **Double-check your answers.** When you have made your selection for each blank, check to make sure that the passage is logically, grammatically, and stylistically coherent.

Sentence Equivalence Questions

### Six-to-two-choice

#### Description

  Like Text Completion questions, Sentence Equivalence questions test the ability to reach a conclusion about how a passage should be completed on the basis of partial information, but to a greater extent they focus on the meaning of the completed whole. Sentence Equivalence questions consist of a single sentence with just one blank, **and they ask you to find two choices that both lead to a complete, coherent sentence** and that produce sentences that mean the same thing.


#### Tips

  Do not simply look among the answer choices for two words that mean the same thing. This can be misleading for two reasons. First, the answer choices may contain pairs of words that mean the same thing but do not fit coherently into the sentence, and thus do not constitute a correct answer. Second, the pair of words that do constitute the correct answer may not mean exactly the same thing, since all that matters is that the resultant sentences mean the same thing.


> - **Read the sentence to get an overall sense of it.**
> - **Identify words or phrases that seem particularly significant,** either because they emphasize the structure of the sentence (words like although or moreover) or because they are central to understanding what the sentence is about.
> - **Think up your own words for the blanks.** Try to fill in the blank with a word that seems to you to fit and then see if two similar words are offered among the answer choices. If you find some word that is similar to what you are expecting but cannot find a second one, do not become fixated on your interpretation; instead, see whether there are other words among the answer choices that can be used to fill the blank coherently.
> - **Double-check your answers.** When you have selected your pair of answer choices for the blank, check to make sure that each one produces a sentence that is logically, grammatically, and stylistically coherent, and that the two sentences mean the same thing

- Quantity A is greater.
- Quantity B is greater.
- The two quantities are equal.
- The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

#### Tips

> - **Become familiar with the answer choices.**
> - **Avoid unnecessary computations.**
> - **Remember that geometric figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.**
> - **Plug in numbers.**
> - **Simplify the comparison.**

Multiple-choice questions—Select One Answer Choice

### Single Choice

#### Description

  These questions are multiple-choice questions that ask you to select only one answer choice from a list of five choices.

#### Tips

> - **Use the fact that the answer is there**
> - **Examine the answer choices**

Multiple-choice questions—Select One or More Answer Choices

### Mulitple-choice

#### Description

  These questions are multiple-choice questions that ask you to select one or more answer choices from a list of choices. A question may or may not specify the number of choices to select. These questions are marked with square boxes beside the answer choices, not circles or ovals.

#### Tips

> - **Note whether you are asked to indicate a specific number of answer choices or all choices that apply.**
> - **In some questions that involve conditions that limit the possible values of numerical answer choices, it may be efficient to determine the least and/or the greatest possible value**
> - **Avoid lengthy calculations by recognizing and continuing numerical patterns.**

## Numeric Entry questions

### Number-Entry

#### Description

  Questions of this type ask you either to enter your answer as an integer or a decimal in a single answer box or to enter it as a fraction in two separate boxes—one for the numerator and one for the denominator. In the computer-delivered test, use the computer mouse and keyboard to enter your answer.


#### Tips

> - **Make sure you answer the question that is asked.**
> - **If you are asked to round your answer, make sure you round to the required degree of accuracy.**
> - **Examine your answer to see if it is reasonable with respect to the information given.**

## Data Interpretation Sets

### One-or-More-Choices

#### Description

  Data Interpretation questions are grouped together and refer to the same table, graph, or other data presentation. These questions ask you to interpret or analyze the given data. **The types of questions may be Multiple-choice (both types) or Numeric Entry.**


#### Tips

> - **Scan the data presentation briefly to see what it is about, but do not spend time studying all of the information in detail.**
> - **Bar graphs and circle graphs, as well as other graphical displays of data, are drawn to scale, so you can read or estimate data visually from such graphs.**
> - **The questions are to be answered only on the basis of the data presented, everyday facts (such as the number of days in a year), and your knowledge of mathematics.**
