### GRE长难句初见
*Theses questions are political in the sense that the debate over them will inevitably be less an exploration of abstract matters in a spirit of disinterested inquiry than an academic power struggle in which the careers and professional fortunes of many women scholars—only now entering the academic profession in substantial numbers—will be at stake, and with them the chances for a distinctive contribution to humanistic understanding, a contribution that might be an important influence against sexism in our society.*

### 长难句分析原则
1. 熟悉某一种语法结构在长难句的表达意思后，尽快过渡到直接阅读句子，不要分析语法结构。
2. 以意群为单位进行阅读。
3. 锻炼自己一遍阅读过的能力。

## 长难句的分类解析
---
#### 复杂修饰成分
1. 从句
2. 介词短语修饰
3. 分词修饰
4. 不定式修饰
*The methods that a community devises to perpetuate itself come into being to preserve aspects of the cultural legacy that that community perceives as essential.*

#### 大段的插入语或同位语
此类难句之所以难，在于其插入成分在句中打断读者的思路，割裂 插入成分前后之间的句意，造成理解上的困难，我们称之为“打岔”。

 读法：插入语的标志是成对出现的逗号。建议初学者凡是在阅读中遇到成对出现的逗号时，或是发现句意尚未完整时出现了逗号，**先跳过插入语，将其前后的内容连起来读**；待句意读完整后再回头读插入语。
*Moreover, I can feel strong emotions in response to objects of art that are
interpretations, rather than representations, of reality.*

#### 倒装
*That sex ratio will be favored which maximizes the number of descendants an individual will have and hence the number of gene copies transmitted.*

其共同点在于：由于应该放在句子前面的成分太长，为了避免头重脚轻而把这些成分倒装到句末

*Black Fiction surveys a wide variety of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some fascinating and little-known works like James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.*

---
#### 省略
*That sex ratio will be favored which maximizes the number of descendants that an individual will have and hence maximizes the number of gene copies transmitted.*
在which的从句中，有两处省略：第一处是在maximize的第一个宾语the number of descendants that an individual will have中，an individual will have是修饰descendants的定语从句，但是因为descendants在从句中 做have的宾语，所以引导词that可以省略。第二处省略是在第二个the number of之前，省略了与前面一样的成分maximizes。“and hence”在此表示后面的成分作为前面“最大化一个个体的后代的数目”的结果

### 长难句的典型结构
---
#### 1. 长成分

- **主语从句**
*That each large firm will act with consideration of its own needs and thus avoid selling its products for more than its competitors charge* is commonly recognized by advocates of free-market economic theories

- **宾语从句**
The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote  in the 1890's  that t*he agrarian discontent that had been developing steadily in the United States since about 1870 had been precipitated  by the closing of the internal frontier — that is, the depletion of available new land needed for further expansion of the American farming system*

- **长状语**
The appreciation  of traditional oral American Indian literature  has been limited, hampered by poor translations and by the difficulty, *even in the rare culturally sensitive and aesthetically satisfying translation, of completely conveying the original's verse structure, tone, and syntax.*

- **层层修饰**
*A very specialized feeding* adaptation *in zooplankton* is that of the tadpolelike appendicularian *who lives in a walnut-sized or smaller balloon of mucusequipped with filters that capture and concentrate phytoplankton.*

- **并列成分**
They were fighting, albeit discrectly, to open the intellectual world to the new science **and** to liberate intellectual life from ecclesiastical philosophy **and** they envisioned their work as contributing to the growth, **not** of philosophy, **but** of research in mathematics and physics.

#### 2. 倒装
1. 及物动词+介词
	在某些词组的固定搭配下，经常会出现倒装结构。这些词组通常由 一个及物动词加上一个介词组成，如bring to，当其表达为bring A to B的 时候，则有可能被倒装成bring to B A.
	
	> Yet Walzer' s argument, however deficient, does point to one of the most serious weaknesses of capitalism—namely, that it **brings** to <u>predominant positions in a society</u> **people** 【who, no matter how legitimately they have earned their material rewards, often lack those other qualities that evoke affection or admiration.】

2. 及物动词+副词
	>Friedrich Engels, however, predicted that women would be liberated  from the “social, legal, and economic subordination” of the family by technological developments that **made possible** the recruitment of “the whole female sex into public industry.”
	
	正常语序应该是：that made the recruitment of "the whole female sex into public  industry"

#### 3. 省略
1. 重复的成分
	>The correlation of carbon dioxide with temperature, of course, does not establish whether changes in atmospheric composition caused the warming and cooling trends or __ were caused by them.

2. 让步转折的省略
	>**Although** many of these historians have accepted the earlier assumption that loyalists represented an upper class, new evidence indicates that Loyalist, like rebels, were drawn from all socioeconomic class.
	
	Although 引导的让步分句和后面的转折语气分句形成对比，但是 **although** 和 **but** 只能出现一次，后面的 **but** 因此被省略。
	只要是在前面的分句中看到表示让步的词汇，就立即在后面的分句前补上一个but；看到后面有表示转折的词汇，立即给前面的内容加上一个although
	
3. 定语从句引导词的省略
	>Because the potential hazards pollen grains are subject to as they are transported over long distances are enormous,...
	
	完整的句子应该是**Because the potential hazards** (that pollen grains are subject to /as they are transported over long distances/) **are enormous**,...

4. 定语从句中的引导词与系动词的同时省略，变成后置定语
	这种典型结构就是：**名词+形容词+介词结构**
	>qualities (such as “the capacity for hard work”) essential in producing wealth

#### 4. 短语被分割
短语或固定搭配被分割得很远，这些短语有such as, so that, too... to, more than, from A to B, between A and B等.
>**Such** variations in size, shape, chemistry, conduction speed, excitation threshold, and the like **as** had been demonstrated in nerve cells remained negligible in significance for any possible correlation with the manifold dimensions of mental experience.

#### 5. 多重否定
>Despite these vague categories, one should not claim unequivocally that hostility between recognizable classes cannot be legitimately observed.

改写成正常语气：*Despite these vague categories, one may still claim definitely that hostility between discernable classes can be validly observed.*
