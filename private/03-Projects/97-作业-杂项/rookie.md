{Hey guys whats up today~, if you're new here, my name is Jeffery Chou. And today we're going to talk about zotero. I have been using zotero for months, and it has taken the role of other kinds of

reference manager like EndNote, Mendeley and so on.

So, in today's video I will introduce my updated workflow for research paper note-taking, how I dealt with the zotero and obsidian and how they impacted the markdown notes workflow, extracting your notes and annotations from your marked up papers into markdown notes for later use.

The workflow is includes the following three main sessions: references finding, references management, and notes management.

I hope this video could inspire you to improve the effieicncy of your current workflow, and answer all your questions, so stay tuned!} -这段画面直接给全配音，参考片头 refer 的那个视频

Before Jumping into the workflow, we need to know the issue, the issue that occurred in paper reading.

Say, issues occures when you are trying to understanding a brand new field of research but having no way to start? or you just have a headache to manager the vast amount of orderless reference papers? or having no idea or connection with the notes you took in papers reading?

Our workflow is designed to address these pain points

before we start, lets briefly introduce the website or softwares we are going to use:

    1. Connected Papers: type a typical paper in Connected Papers and it will build you a web chain map of similar papers in the field. You can use it to quickly get a visual overview of a new academic field, make sure you haven't missed the important paper, and discover the most relevant prior and derivative works.

    *In short, Connected Papers is a visual paper search software that helps novice academics quickly become familiar with an academic field.*

    2. Zotero: Zotero is free and open source software for helping people collect, organize, cite, and share research. zotero makes it easy to save content of interest to you as you browse the web and create citations for your research. It also has a rich ecosystem of plugins that can help you extend its functionality to meet your individual needs.

    *In short, Zotero is a powerful paper management software that helps you conduct your research more easily and efficiently.*

    3. Obsidian: OBSIDIAN is a note taking application that helps you create, organize and link your ideas. It uses the concept of networked notes, allowing you to create links between notes to explore your ideas and knowledge graph faster. obsidian also has a rich ecosystem of plugins that make it quick and easy to implement a variety of note formats such as shorthand, mind maps, tables, lists, and more.

    *In short, OBSIDIAN is a powerful and easy-to-use note-taking application that helps you better organize and manage your ideas!*
