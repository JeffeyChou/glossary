## Abstract

Given a probability distribution, its corresponding information volume is Shannon entropy. However, how to determine the information volume of a given mass function is still an open issue. Based on Deng entropy, the information volume of mass function is presented in this paper. Given a mass function, the corresponding information volume is larger than its uncertainty measured by Deng entropy. In addition, when the cardinal of the frame of discernment is identical, both the total uncertainty case and the BPA distribution of the maximum Deng entropy have the same information volume. Some numerical examples are illustrated to show the eï¬ƒciency of the proposed information volume of mass function.
