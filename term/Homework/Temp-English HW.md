> [!tips] Abstract
> The ability to recognize individual conspecifics from their vocalizations is an adaptive trait in social and territorial animals, including humans. Voice recognition relies on linguistic (phonological) representations and is thought to be impaired in individuals with dyslexia due to the disorder's underlying phonological processing deficits. This study tested participants with and without dyslexia on their ability to recognize voices speaking their native language (English) or an unfamiliar, foreign language (Mandarin Chinese) and found that dyslexic participants were impaired in recognizing English-speaking voices but not in recognizing Chinese-speaking voices. This deficit is attributed to a weakness in language learning that contributes to impoverished long-term phonological representations in dyslexia. This reliance on language distinguishes human voice recognition from nonhuman animal vocalization recognition.

The paper could benefit from providing more information on the demographic characteristics of the sample, such as age, gender, and educational history.

One potential avenue for future research could be to explore whether interventions targeting phonological processing could improve voice recognition ability in dyslexic individuals.

The abstract could benefit from using technical terminology ot increase the precision of the abstract, emphasize the significance of the research findings by highlighting their potential implications or applications, and present it in a shorter way.

(From my point of view, there is no significant difference between these two versions of the abstract, which means that there is not much significant improvement. So I prefer to use the 'another version' as the barter instead of using 'improved version')

> Voice is the principal medium not only for the individual recognization among social and territorial animals, but also for the human capacity of language. Voice recognition relies on phonological representations and is thought to be impaired in individuals with dyslexia due to the disorder's underlying phonological processing deficits. The proposed paper tested participants with and without dyslexia on their ability to recognize voices speaking English or an unfamiliar language (Mandarin Chinese) and found that dyslexics were impaired in recognizing English-speaking voices but not in Chinese-speaking case. This deficit is attributed to a weakness in language learning that contributes to impoverished long-term phonological representations in dyslexia. This reliance on language distinguishes human voice recognition from nonhuman animal vocalization recognition.
